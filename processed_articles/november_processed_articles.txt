He's a venture capitalist who's obsessed with how media and entertainment can be more interactive and interconnected. He's also a huge fan of basketball and hockey. So he's been thinking deeply about what COVID has done to live sports.\n\nMB: Think about all of the fans who go to a match. They want to chirp. They want to praise. They want to yell advice, to critique the coach, and to scream, \"Defense! Defense! Defense!\" You can do that at home. It feels largely empty. Some of us still do it anyway. But I think everyone has felt that desire to be felt in the stadium. And while sports is back, much of that experience can't be replicated.\n\nCW: Of course, we've always watched our favorite teams from home. And we still can right now. But we're seeing just how much of sports fandom goes\n\n01:00\n\nbeyond just watching players on a screen.\n\nMB: We know for a fact that when you go to a movie, you laugh more than when you watch that same movie at home. We know that when you're at home, you laugh more if you're with others than if you're alone. All of those matter to the experience. We know that there are going to be many more games, many more weeks, potentially months, where this experience is missing. And we know how important that is.\n\nCW: Sports leagues know this too. And they've actually been at the forefront of tech innovations in home entertainment for a while. They've led the way in HD, given us some of the earliest forms of augmented reality, and cultivated one of the world's oldest, strongest forms of fandom, with most sports fans rarely going to see the game in person. MB: This idea that the at-home audience was an opportunity, has existed for decades. What's changed is that that at-home experience, the ability to unite people in different homes sitting by themselves, is not an opportunity, it's a critical solution\n\n02:00\n\npoint for the industry.\n\nCW: This is Networked: The 5G Future, a podcast from Verizon and T Brand at The New York Times. I'm Christina Warren. As a reporter and analyst, I've spent years covering how technology changes the way we work, play and connect online. Throughout this series, I'm learning how this new generation of wireless technology could pave the way for some major advances in every part of our lives, from education to healthcare to music. In this episode, I'll talk with expert analysts who see sports through the lens of data and technology. Then I'll meet with the Chief Information Officer of the NFL to learn about how stadiums powered by Verizon 5G could give us new ways of experiencing the game, no matter where we are. And that brings me back to my conversation with Matthew Ball, who's been thinking about how to recreate the missing connections between fans and players. He was especially thinking about how, in every professional sport,\n\n03:00\n\nteams seem to do better when they play in their hometown or home country, partly because their own fans are in the stands to support them.\n\nMB: The challenge is, of course, is well by definition that means that when you're traveling, when you're not in your home country, your fans can't help.\n\nCW: What would it take to establish a seamless two-way connection between fans at home and players in the field? And what would that experience feel like? Well, for starters, it would take an incredibly fast connection.\n\nMB: If what you're asking for is real time fan support, then it's a problem if the fans are one to two seconds behind. And so we do need some modernization in the delivery, the infrastructure, how fast that video in gameplay reaches the audience. We're talking about milliseconds. And to some extent that sounds absurd. We're talking about literally thousandths of a second. And yet for humans, the tolerance tends to be around 50 milliseconds before we can\n\n04:00\n\nnotice a delay. And when we notice that delay, it is truly experience breaking.\n\nCW: That latency is distracting enough when just watching game. But it would have to be truly nonexistent for players to hear fans from home, for fans to hear each other, to feel like you're there. Remember, Matthew's also an investor. So for him, this is about a whole new business opportunity, a way to give millions of home viewers new ways to participate.\n\nMB: And I think part of the hope in interactivity is that it will give more of a reason to tune into the entire game. If you not being there for tip-off is known by the team, is known by the other fans, if the second or third minute of the match has a fan v. fan competition, much like you see in the stadium today, then there's a reason for you to show up.\n\nCW: When I asked what Matthew would personally want most from the next generation of sports live streaming, he answered like a true analyst.\n\nMB: I'm data inclined. I like to know everything about what's happening. Everything that's happening, not just in terms of\n\n05:00\n\nwhy a player is going left versus right, but why that player is on the team in the first place, where he historically struggles, where he usually shoots, and the odds that that shot goes in. The idea that I can't yet watch a live version of the game, that you can't see the ball in the air with the live odds, based on the trajectory, that's not something that everybody wants, but the success of a number of database sites in major league sports tells you there's an audience for it.\n\nCW: So you basically want like five real time data terminals overlaid on top of the game as you watch at all times.\n\nMB: I think if you keep that in the recording, it's going to horrify many of your listeners. But as they say, you are who you are.\n\nCW: Sports fans do have a history of obsessing over data and how that data fits into the stories of their favorite teams. The sports industry, most famously through sabermetrics has also embraced data to help make decisions\n\n06:00\n\nabout recruiting and team strategy. Nobody gets this more than Nancy Hensley, who recently became the Chief Marketing and Product Officer at Stats Perform, which is an analytics firm specialized in sports.\n\nNH: I think the thing I'm most excited about in my new role at Stats Perform is the fact that I get paid to talk about sports and data all day long, every day of the week. That's pretty cool.\n\nCW: Nancy's been going to baseball games in Chicago since she was a kid. So when sports paused in the spring, she had to take a step back and grapple with what this would do to the industry, and especially to lifelong fans like her.\n\nNH: Yeah, it was interesting when, when everything kind of stopped, my first reaction was, \"Well, you know, sports is going to come back.\" And I think about sitting in Wrigley Field and all of the, there was just a huge crowd of really elderly fans there. And I used to always say, \"Hey, you know, that little old lady that's sitting out front, season ticket holder for 50 years? I totally want to be that lady.\"\n\nCW: You seem totally\n\n07:00\n\nconfident that sports wouldn't go away.\n\nNH: Yeah.\n\nCW: Why was that?\n\nNH: It's one of those things that always unifies people. And because there's just, it's so beloved, and it's something that we're so used to and so much a part of our lives for so many people, that there will always be this pent-up demand for, for sports and games.\n\nCW: Talk to me a little bit about how sports and data came together in your life.\n\nNH: I have always been a data nerd. Always loved it. Fell in love with analytics and data when I started to see how much it can actually influence or change the course of a business. And I think that's always been one of the reasons why I love data is because it does challenge you to look at things differently.\n\nCW: For people who've never thought about this, could you help out with a basic explanation about what sports data is?\n\nNH: Yeah, I mean, there's a couple different kinds of sports data that people would refer to when they're talking about data. One is the event data. So things that happen in the course of the game. How many hits? How many runs? How many errors?\n\n08:00\n\nHow many on base? How many home runs? And then there's tracking data. And tracking data really is translating players' movements to data, which help us understand things like playing styles and roles and movements on the field and deeper analytics.\n\nCW: So what's the process there? Because obviously, there's a tremendous amount of data that is being collected so that you can put these, you know, bottles in a tool so that the coaches or the recruiters or whoever else can have access to them. But how, how are you capturing that data?\n\nNH: We do about, I think about half a million events a year that we cover. We also can pull data from broadcast video using computer vision. You can think of it almost as a time machine, we can go back and pull that tracking data, that deep data out of an actual broadcast video.\n\nCW: So where's the whole world of sports metrics going to go next?\n\nNH: I actually think that it's going to be shifting more towards that fan experience and providing a highly personalized experience\n\n09:00\n\nwith the data and information that that fan wants in the palm of their hand. More analytics, more statistics, more knowledge, a deeper knowledge even at a specific player level. I think a lot of people really want to know more about the players that they love. And a more personalized experience to what they, what they are used to with sports.\n\nCW: How important though, is it for that data to be in real time and to be, I guess, in sync with what's happening, especially as the live experience of sports changes?\n\nNH: I think very important. A lot of the analysis that teams do today is very much rearview mirror. Not enough live predictions. I think we're getting better and better at it today. But I think when you, when you think about when you're watching a game, and something happens that you don't agree with, you're always like, why would that, why would they coach make that call? Or why would they put that person in as designated hitter? Like, you want to know at that time what the strategy of the game is. And\n\n10:00\n\nbecause of some of the technologies that are coming available on the consumer side, like my phone that's got 5G, for example, can do more than my phone of four years ago, we're in a good position to enable that, let's call it a second screen experience.\n\nCW: Say, if we all had 5G connections fully up and running, what would be the dream feature, or a dream viewing experience that you would be most excited about as a fan?\n\nNH: I would love to have, like, be able to choose the players I want a deeper level of live statistics on. Deeper statistics than just what you see on the screen. I think 5G can definitely enable some of that. I also think that when we get to the point where as a fan, and I have a second screen experience, and I can personally have different camera angles. I don't want the cameraman to choose which angle. I want to look at this angle of the field, right? And maybe it's because you're looking at your favorite player, maybe it's because you just want a different view. And I think none of that would be capable with a slower\n\n11:00\n\ntechnology. And I think 5G's gonna be able to give us a really good second screen experience because of the low latency capabilities there.\n\nCW: As you're building out this new ecosystem of sports data for fans, what is the biggest challenge that you're going to face?\n\nNH: I always feel like you've got to make sure that you're not overwhelming fans with information, right? You want to give them the signal through the noise. Not give them so much data and statistics that they can't find meaning in that. Really understanding the, the different segment of fans and what they want, I think is going to be really, really important, and probably the biggest challenge we have.\n\nCW: What do you think that fans want out of this? And like, what do you see, you know, working to kind of engage fans and bring them into this, this data rich world?\n\nNH: I really think people focus on specific players that they love. And so they want a little bit more in-depth data about their favorite players. I think they're also really curious about players coming in, that are new to the team\n\n12:00\n\nand league that they know, and what, you know, what they can do maybe some predictive data about this kid that just came up from the minor leagues. It's one thing to have data and do analysis, but the person who can tell the story around that data is the one that's going to get the most engagement.\n\nCW: Nancy, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. And next year, you and me, Wrigley Field.\n\nNH: Absolutely. Thank you, Christina, for having me. And I will take you up on that because there is nothing better than an afternoon at Wrigley.\n\nCW: Fans like Nancy and me are holding out for the day when we can come back to the stands and just enjoy the game with our friends and family. But in the meantime, the NFL isn't waiting to keep that feeling going. They're moving full speed ahead using Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband to start creating more immersive experiences for people in the stadiums, and at home. I'll find out more after the break.\n\n13:00\n\nMidroll Ad\n\nVerizon 5G Edge is the world's first mobile edge computing platform with AWS Wavelength, and it's rolling out in select cities around the country. It's built right so faster speed and ultra low latency now come to mobile and connected devices paving the way for a wide range of transformative applications. The implications for rapid innovation are staggering. And now businesses and developers can harness its power, today and into the future. Verizon 5G Edge is here from the network businesses rely on.\n\nCW: Welcome back to Networked: The 5G Future. I'm Christina Warren. Talking to investor, Matthew Ball, and sports statsguru, Nancy Hensley, highlighted the devotion and analysis that surrounds sports. Those conversations also pointed to how Verizon's 5G network could enable new innovations when it comes to how we watch and talk about the game. To find out exactly how this could happen. I went straight to the source.\n\nMM: I'm Michelle McKenna. I am\n\n14:00\n\nChief Information Officer at the NFL. And I'm responsible for the league's technology, strategy and deployment across all of our league activities including game day.\n\nSS: My name is Sanyogita Shamsunder. I lead the technology development and innovation organization at Verizon as part of the global network and technology organization.\n\nCW: The NFL and Verizon have partnered to bring 5G Ultrawideband to 22 NFL stadiums, with more in the works.\n\nMM: And they've taken us through each and every step of the way on enabling our stadiums to be the most connected and the most amazing in stadium experiences in the world. 5G is going to bring on really cool applications that the fans will see. But it's also going to power so much of how we actually transact the game as well.\n\nCW: Sanyogita, can you tell me more about why the stadium is a good setting to help kind of realize the power of 5G?\n\nSS: Yeah, so I think it's a fantastic petri dish, if I\n\n15:00\n\nmay use the word. It is action-filled. It has consumers. Most importantly, year over year, the amount of data our fans consume in stadiums is a testament to the fact that connectivity is an important part of the fan experience inside. So it gives us a chance to test not only some of the things such as like, Wayfinding, but also individually, what fans can, can consume on their own, whether it be other games that they're watching at the same time that they are in the stadium, or sharing content with their friends who are outside of the stadium, several million watching at home as well. So we as a connectivity provider, both mobile and home, cannot ask for a better partnership.\n\n15:40\n\nCW: You talked about the fan experience and why that's important. I'm curious, Michelle, why is the fan experience so important, especially when we're thinking about, you know, trying to deliver that experience to people who are at home right now?\n\nMM: We know that a big part of the success of our game is fans and attendance and fans sitting in those stands and the energy that comes from that.\n\n16:00\n\nAnd with 5G we believe there are applications that can put them physically in the stadium.They can choose a seat to sit from one day and see the game from that angle. They can move around and have different virtual reality type experiences, all augmenting the in-stadium experience with, of course, continuing to make that home experience great. So, you know, while we always believe the best place to watch a game is in the stadium, we do want to make that excitement available to as many people as possible and 5G and the applications that we're building on top of such fast and reliable connectivity is what's going to make us be able to do that.\n\nSS: Just the other day, we released a watch together app where you could, you know, watch together with three or four friends a game and you didn't have to switch out to a different medium. So you're experiencing the game, as well as your interactions with your friends in the, in the same app. Earlier this year at the Superbowl we had a way to stream multiple\n\n17:00\n\nangles from even within the stadium, and then also have AR stats overlaid by, by player. So all that requires a lot more bandwidth and a lot more compute needed to process this. And essentially COVID has, has accelerated some of these experiences as well and given us an opportunity to test some of these in the near term.\n\nCW: And I'm just curious what does 5G mean for broadcasting football games?\n\nSS: At a stadium there are hundreds of different cameras. And one of the use cases that we, you know, we were working with with NFL, was be able to have the flexibility to place cameras at will as the production starts, right. You don't have to plan way ahead of time because 5G provides that flexibility to move the cameras around to wherever you want and, and, and broadcast from whatever location inside the stadium. So that's a 5G broadcast type of a use case. It provides some of the flexibility, removes some of the friction in terms of planning from a broadcast viewpoint.\n\nMM: Just think about a, sort of cordless\n\n18:00\n\ncamera. You know how you have Wranglers that are running everywhere with cords, things that are plugged in for speed and reliability of connections. I mean, the day when we can literally cut the cords on all of the technology that you see on the sideline will be revolutionary.\n\nCW: When the network is fully available and you get to cut those cords, how will the stadium itself change? How will that experience change?\n\nMM: I think just the whole touchless environment which the situation that we're in right now made us move to that very quickly. There are certain things where we have to be plugged in. So like a ticketing situation. So just imagine that everything's mobile, and you get to just walk in either using some sort of biometric, and you just walk in. Ingress and egress in and out of stadiums would get much better.\n\nCW: So then what's the biggest single challenge in realizing this vision of what we're talking about with stadiums with being able to have so much of it go wireless.\n\n19:00\n\nMM: Our stadiums are very unique. You cannot apply sort of standard corporate protocols and have it work. To light up a stadium for 5G means you've got the bowl, the lower bowl, the concourses, the parking lots, unlike if you were to put 5G in the middle of a city park where it could easily cover all of the acreage of the park. We also have, probably one of the hardest things I learned coming to the NFL, is we have a major frequency congestion issue in our stadiums. If you imagine all the types of things, everybody's got a watch, everybody's got a phone, all the players have chips on them. We've got multiple tablets along both sidelines. We have every camera. We have every remote microphone. All of those use up frequency. And so the other good thing about 5G is where it's going to be operating and in the frequency band that it's\n\n20:00\n\ngoing to be operating will help move some of the congestion out of other places. Solving that is not an easy task. And Verizon is the leader in this space. And so we rely on them to help us with that.\n\nCW: So where do you think professional sports are heading in the coming years? And how does 5G play into that?\n\nSS: It's going to be seamless in the sense that the fan doesn't think about it twice while doing it. Whether you're consuming this at home, or whether you're consuming it in the stadium, is basically going to be driven by connectivity, uber-connectivity everywhere, and a lot of compute power. Because many of these things you're relying on data driven technologies, such as AI, ML. And when we talk about data driven technologies, you cannot do that without a strong connectivity paradigm.\n\nCW: Sanyogita, Michelle, I'm so excited to think about the future and what this means for live sports. And I'm really looking forward to getting back into a stadium that's been set up with all of these Verizon 5G capabilities. Thank you so much\n\n21:00\n\nfor taking the time to talk to me.\n\nSS: Thank you. It's been my pleasure.\n\nMM: You're welcome. It was great. It was so fun to talk about 5G and we know it's going to change everything, including sports.\n\nCW: Whether you're a data hungry sports nerd, a super fan who's missing the feeling of being fully immersed in a live game, or even a casual fan who wants a more interactive experience, the arrival of Verizon 5G stadiums connecting to your 5G devices at home could open the door to a new age of sports fandom with more ways to see the action, follow the stories and strategies of your favorite teams, and experience every season, together. On the next episode of Networked, what can the music world learn from people who first found their own passion for music online? And what does the future of live performance sound like?\n\nBT: So now I'm thinking what happens with AI because that's going to change what's possible for music. Music doesn't have to start at zero and end at three minutes. It can be more\n\n22:00\n\ninfinite. It can be more flexible. And it can be more unique or more custom to the listener.\n\nCW: I'll find out how artists, fans and live experience creators are adapting to make sure the beat goes on.

Which should we gift to our loved ones \u2014 or to ourselves?\n\nThere are plenty of options. Beginning Thursday, Sony will ship two versions of the PlayStation 5: a $500 model that includes a disc drive, and a smaller $400 disc-free version that runs downloaded games.

It feels, in short, like we live in a city. Despite my sailing background, I am an unapologetic city person. But during those first months of shelter-in-place, the skyline was empty and quiet, the playgrounds taped off, the raucous energy of the Bay Area silenced. It was deeply unnerving to stand on our boat deck and see only the occasional car on the interstate, not a plane in the sky.\n\nEven so, the forced break from our collective business gave me room to breathe. Given all that was happening in the world, I can\u2019t imagine remembering the early days of the pandemic fondly. But in those moments, when my mind went to the darkest of dark places, I took comfort in our boat-home and all of the ways it was the best possible place for us to be.\n\nBut life aboard the Red Headed Stranger isn\u2019t idyllic. Like living on a farm or a remote corner of Alaska, it is both magnificent and messy \u2014 challenging in ways you can\u2019t fully appreciate until you\u2019ve experienced them. For me, early on, the learning curve sometimes felt insurmountable. Boats are complex systems. Marinas are peculiar places. Tim and I have had to become intimate with marine plumbing in a way I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone. We\u2019ve lost innumerable Legos, two iPhones, and a high chair (long story) to the voracious waters of the estuary. We installed a new washer-dryer using the boat\u2019s built-in dinghy crane, a feat that involved swinging a $1,200 appliance over the open water.\n\nAnd we regularly fend off the excesses of our fellow boat owners, who bumper-car around the marina when their motors, or they themselves, are too impaired to navigate. Even during normal times, living on a boat was more exciting \u2014 with higher highs and lower lows \u2014 than our landlocked, apartment-dwelling life.\n\nThe pandemic had already upended that reality. Then the wildfires arrived.\n\nThe fires burned for months, one after the next. Surrounded by water, we were fortunate to be spared from the flames that consumed so much of our region. But the fires created a blanket of smoke that forced us indoors for weeks at a time. With two small, extremely active children, our boat-home went from a peaceful refuge to a squalid, claustrophobic animal shelter. We were the animals, and we were increasingly feral.\n\nWithout its openness to the outdoors \u2014 the hours on its roof deck, painting or splashing or hammock-swinging, the barbecues and boat drinks on the back deck, the socially distant get-togethers with a dear friend who arrived by sailing dinghy or paddle board \u2014 the boat became a goldfish bowl with a 360-degree view of a horrifyingly orange sky. But the worst of it was the heat. Old boats, like old houses, are drafty. They\u2019re built to breathe. Suddenly, the boat\u2019s airiness was not just another quirk of boat life, but a genuine danger. To keep the smoke out, we sealed ourselves in, using insulated cardboard to block vents and seals around the doors. Our salon, as the main living area is called, reached 100-plus degrees. The air was suffocating and stagnant. What we\u2019d loved about the room, its loft-like wall-to-wall windows, now made me feel like a fly trapped between dual-pane glass."], "20201106": [], "20201107": [], "20201108": [], "20201109": [], "20201110": [], "20201111": ["Good morning.\n\nThere are still votes left to count in California.

Sometimes those weeks turn into months or even years, and you begin to wonder if the universe is out to get you.\n\nThis year has been one of those weeks on a giant scale.\n\n\u201cThe sad truth is that the pandemic and all of the upheaval it\u2019s caused is nothing compared to what\u2019s going to be happening in the next decade in terms of weather events,\u201d said Sheldon Solomon, a researcher and social psychologist.\n\nAlongside the psychologists Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pyszczynski, Dr. Solomon studies terror management theory, a concept that claims much of human behavior is ultimately driven by our primal fear over our own mortality. When bad things happen, especially when those things seem random and meaningless, we crave a sense of understanding and, ultimately, control. If a family member has a critical illness, for example, you may want to research treatments online, look for a better doctor or pray. While there are personal and practical reasons to do these things, it\u2019s also about feeling productive \u2014 doing something gives you a sense of control over the outcome. Even when control is largely an illusion, it makes you feel better.\n\n\u201cSo much of what we think and do is driven by these relatively primal processes,\u201d Dr. Solomon said.\n\nWhen a series of unfortunate events seems unrelenting, we lose that sense of control and find ourselves stuck in a downward spiral of negativity.", "Episode transcription\n\nGo back to Homepage\n\n00:00\n\nMR: A ha ha! \"Loop Daddy\" is not something I came up with.\n\nCW: That's Marc Rebillet, a.k.a. \u201cLoop Daddy.\u201d He's an electronic musician who's best known for his hours-long, over-the-top performances on livestream. He creates these infectious beats and songs on the fly by recording himself playing a hook, or singing a melody, then letting it repeat on a loop. Every loop becomes a layer of the song until Marc becomes a one man band.\n\n00:28\n\nMR: It's something that in the early days of me streaming my performances online, I was sort of introduced to it by someone who was looking at the common thread there and asking me questions, and one of them was whether or not I was comfortable being called \"Loop Daddy.\" And I really love it. It was sort of a done deal. And I embrace it.\n\nCW: Marc is a digital-first musician with over 10 million streams. He performs mostly from his own apartment, but also\n\n01:00\n\nlivestreams his in-person shows, which he's been doing more and more of over the last few years. Then, like every other touring musician facing the Coronavirus, he had to shut everything down.\n\nMR: We had to make a, you know, 24-hours-before call to postpone the tour. Just the knowledge that there are hundreds or thousands of people that bought tickets, and planned their night and at the last minute, you have to pull the rug out from, from under everybody. And that just kills me, even if it makes sense. You know, at the end of the day, it's just a concert. So it's really not the end of the world. But it's, it just really sucks to have to do that to people who are trying to support you, you know.\n\n01:48\n\nCW: So he hunkered down in his apartment, turned on his livestream and used his talents to raise over $20,000 for pandemic relief. Then he got a call from his agents about drive-in concerts\n\n02:00\n\nthat were popping up in Germany.\n\nMR: Agents who were looking for ways to be creative were, were sort of scoping out the drive-in theater scene over there. But there hadn't been any of that that had matriculated to the United States yet. So they said, you know, \"What do you think about this?\" I said, \"Let's do a tour. Let's do a tour.\" I mean, can we do it? Is it possible? I don't know.\n\n02:25\n\nCW: This is Networked: The 5G Future, a podcast from Verizon and T Brand. I'm Christina Warren. As a reporter and analyst I've spent years covering how technology changes the way we work, play and connect online. Throughout this series, I'm learning how this new generation of wireless technology could pave the way for some major advances in every part of our lives, from education to health care to sports. In this episode, I'm hearing about the ways that artists and fans are adapting to a world, where our favorite musicians are performing online.\n\n03:00\n\nCW: I'll find out how Verizon 5G can help keep the beat going. And make live music more immersive and interactive... when it's finally time for us to get back together for a show.\n\nSpeaking of which... even though Marc Rebillet could have kept live streaming, he was determined to pull off a cross country tour that could be safe, fun and just as real as a club show, with 1,000 people on the floor.\n\n03:24\n\nMR: All of the audio visual and projection equipment that a drive-in theater is outfitted with is situated in the back behind the cars, never in front, because in order to have everything set up, we needed to be somewhere near the projector and near these components. You know, my audio visual team would be in this trailer that was outfitted like a CIA wiretap van that had a multi, a multi screen setup for multiple cameras, a mixing board, an FM transmitter, all sorts of drone stuff,\n\n04:00\n\nand wires, and all of that would feed into a tent.\n\nCW: In that tent, Marc set up his gear, surrounded himself with green screens and basically live streamed to the movie screen.\n\nMR: But then the problem with that is because I'm behind the cars, you don't actually see me. You need to understand that I'm there. You need to connect with me. You need to see me. You need to make eye contact with me. I need to be there in front of you. So I start out in the front by the screen. We have a big ladder. I'm up on top of the ladder. Then I get in a golf cart and we go around the whole damn parking lot. My robe is going everywhere and I'm yelling and every, you know, in between all the rows, everyone can see me until I get to the tent, then I play the show.\n\nCW: The creative challenges of socially distanced live shows were really no problem for Marc. But the technical challenges of running a multi camera, multi channel,\n\n05:00\n\nlivestream improvisational concert\u2026 Well, he and his team made it happen. But they were troubleshooting at every step of the way to make that experience seamless.\n\nMR: What I discovered was, because we're transmitting this signal to cars in the parking lot via FM radio, and a lot of these people have their windows open, when I play, they're hearing me a number of milliseconds later. It's, uh, or maybe even a second later. It's a delay that's significant enough that you can really hear it. So there was just a lot of sort of internal juggling I had to do in terms of making sure I was staying focused exclusively on my signal and not on the audience's signal.\n\n05:48\n\nCW: And the sound wasn't the only signal that Marc had trouble with during these drive-in shows.\n\nMR: You know, I, I listen for feedback when I'm playing. I listen for feedback from the, the crowd. You know, according to my\n\n06:00\n\ntour manager and other people that were out in the parking lot, you could really hear it when you're out there. But when I'm in my tent, it's, it's just very difficult to get that feedback. So you have to trust your instincts and trust that what you're doing is entertaining enough and, and people are, are hopefully enjoying themselves. But yeah, it's, it's just a weird thing.\n\n06:24\n\nCW: Marc's drive-in tour worked because he had spent years performing online. He mastered how to move the audience no matter where they are and he brought those skills into this socially distanced set-up without missing a beat. But a lot of artists are trying to figure out that dynamic for the first time.\n\nMR: There's a lot of hurdles that can make it very difficult to reach an online audience in a way that represents what you do fully.\n\nCW: As musicians take on those hurdles, how can they use better connectivity to make live performance more of an interactive experience? To find out, I called Bas Grasmayer.\n\n07:00\n\nBG: I'm the founder of Music x Tech x Future. One, it's a newsletter about music and innovation. But two, it's also kind of my vehicle for consulting companies and individuals about matters of like, innovation, technology, digital strategy, specifically focused on the music business and adjacent industries.\n\n07:18\n\nCW: He\u2019s spent most of his career navigating the evolution of music distribution from analog to digital to streaming, and imagining how fundamental changes in tech like 5G might reshape the landscape for listeners and creators. As a fan and producer of electronic music, he shared a story with me about how he really dived into music after seing a video as a kid in the Netherlands.\n\nBG: Okay, so like one day, I came home from school, and I saw a music video by a rapper from New York. And he was talking about how, uh, ironically, how hip hop is not what you see on TV, that there's much more to it than cars, and like all the kind of default materialism. And I liked how provocative he was in that.\n\n08:00\n\nSo I bought the album. And then from there, just the whole journey started.\n\nCW: Did hip hop directly inspire you to start making music? Or were there other moments that also contributed?\n\nBG: I think it was hip hop. I started writing lyrics. I started spending a lot of time on internet forums. So this is probably 2001-2002? So people didn't really typically have easy ways to record. So instead, you would have like just written text-based battles and lyric competitions and stuff like that. And people would just post their lyrics. And that inspired me to start like getting actively involved in the creative aspects of music.\n\n08:33\n\nCW: So thinking about how much has changed since you were pointing text based rap battles, so cool, what is the kind of musical tool that could really open up new possibilities for creators. today?\n\nBG: I, okay, one thing that I'm personally really excited about is the use of artificial intelligence for creative purposes. So you can feed all kinds of sounds to neural nets, which is basically kind of self, self-learning systems.\n\nCW: Yeah, yeah. I actually was just reading about a\n\n09:00\n\nneural net program that can learn a bunch of songs of a certain artist or genre and then generate an original song, including vocals. Have you seen that?\n\nBG: Yeah. Yeah. And so I think that's super exciting. And I think it's a departure from this specific era in music. And I think that era began with the recording making its way into everyone's house. Like the internet changed like the music business, but I don't think it has changed music that much, yet, music as a, I don't know, as a medium or as a phenomenon. But the recording definitely did. Because before, if you wanted to hear your favorite song, for instance, you better know how to play it or sing it or someone else in your, like, household better know. So music had like something really participative. And now just consider a song, what might be your favorite song, and let's say you make a recording of it. It will not be like the real version. People will consider like the original recording by like some famous artist, they will consider that like the real version. And any cover version, like the fake version.\n\n10:00\n\nAnd that's a relatively new characteristic of music. Because, yeah, music was way more communal. There were like nobody had heard the original writer of the song, or who they thought was like the, the originating artist of a song. And songs would just kind of live and be around.\n\nCW: Right.\n\nBT: So that's such an important change, I think, to music. And created like the recording industry, which is what we typically kind of refer to when we say music business nowadays. We talk about like the record labels. And before that it was like the publishing industry. So the people who are, who are putting out the sheet music that people could play on pianos, or, or sing and stuff like that. So now I'm thinking, \"What happens with AI?\" because that's going to change what's possible for music. Music doesn't have to start at zero and end at whatever is like the end of the song, let's say three minutes. It can be more infinite. It can be more flexible. And it can be more unique or more custom to the listener.\n\nCW: And not just to the listener, right, but also musicians. So\n\n11:00\n\nI'm sure that as AI becomes more accessible to people through their phones, then this could open up new ways for music fans to become creators.\n\nBG: So I think what is cool with AI specifically, is that you can make it way easier for people to create something that sounds like as good as the type of things they normally hear, which is like, it's a really steep learning curve and things like that. It won't be like, you know, mega original or something like that, probably, but it will feel like it's theirs and it's like fun to play around with.\n\n11:27\n\nCW: And to your point, this could be a way where you're able to generate, I don't know, like using an AI, kind of a base song that sounds pretty good. And then make the modifications to it to suit your needs?\n\nBG: Kind of. I think one thing that is also really important is the interface. Like what do people see when they interact with this? I think if you open a music production program and show it to someone, or show someone a studio with like all the buttons, people are like, \"Whoa, I don't know what to do there.\" It's just too, too overwhelming. So what you can do, and this is also happening in smart speakers,\n\n12:00\n\nis that you can make interfaces, maybe more conversational or, or intelligent, meaning the interface will try to interpret what the user is telling it, and then give something back and then get feedback on that.\n\n12:12\n\nCW: Right right, so then when you think about how fans interact with artists, how could we see 5G-powered AI start to change those interactions?\n\nBG: We have like kind of a fledgling Internet of Things, meaning, especially with rollout of 5G, we'll be able to get like way more connected devices online. They'll be supported by networks and, and processing that is made way, way better by artificial intelligence. And I think with all these kind of trends converging, we're going to see these layers of our reality merging. And in that context, I'm really curious, like, what music experiences will be like. Some artists are creating like avatars for themselves. They could AI power them, so that these avatars can kind of be characters\n\n13:00\n\nthat exist on their own without needing to be constantly controlled by an artist, which means that you can kind of boot up an artist avatar and bring it into your, into your environment like the, the dancing hot dog from Snapchat, if you remembered that?\n\nCW: Yes, yes.\n\nBG: But in a way more high definition version of that. All of that, it sounds really fantastic. And I think it's like less than 10 years away. I wouldn't be surprised if it's less than five years away.\n\n13:25\n\nCW: Bas, thanks for taking the time to talk to me about your insights on music and technology and tech space rap battles, which I had no idea existed. Thank you so much.\n\nBG: Thank you so much for having me. I really hope we'll both get to see some like live music whether at a drive in or something virtual very soon.\n\n13:45\n\nCW: With Verizon 5G starting to roll out across the country, could the mixed reality music experiences that Bas mentioned be here even sooner than we think?\n\nCW: I'll find out by hearing about a groundbreaking augmented reality live show, after the break.\n\n14:00\n\nMidroll Ad: Verizon 5G Edge is the world's first mobile edge computing platform with AWS Wavelength, and it's rolling out in select cities around the country. It's built right so faster speed and ultra low latency now come to mobile and connected devices paving the way for a wide range of transformative applications. The implications for rapid innovation are staggering. And now businesses and developers can harness its power, today and into the future. Verizon 5G Edge is here, from the network businesses rely on.\n\n14:35\n\nCW: Welcome back to Networked: The 5G Future. I'm Christina Warren.\n\nCW: Fans like Bas Grasmeyer and musicians like Marc Rebillet gave me hope about all the possibilities for live performance, musical subcultures and creative outlets that could really take off on a 5G network.\n\nCW: But as a huge music fan myself, I wanted to know how Verizon 5G Ultrawideband could improve the shows that I'm looking forward to seeing in person.\n\n15:00\n\nCW: To hear from someone who's already produced a mixed reality performance, I called Kevin Chernett.\n\nCW: He's Executive Vice President of Global Partnerships and Innovation at Live Nation, and partnered with Verizon in December 2019 to rig a major concert venue with 5G.\n\n15:17\n\nKC: We had a terrific project that we worked on together this past year, round the Chainsmokers. The shared goal was to create a fan experience that involve the creativity of the artists. That was really the goal. And so we determined that one of the best demonstrations of the use of 5G would be to create a simultaneous experience in the middle of a concert that involved the artists' participation so it was consistent with the creative they were trying to promote at that show, and really take advantage of 5G in a way that takes advantage of the simultaneous delivery of the experiences, which is something that\n\n16:00\n\nwe typically don't have the luxury to do.\n\nCW: Actually, I want to hone in on this a little bit. Can you walk us through the Chainsmokers event from the perspective of a fan? Like, what did fans experience at this event?\n\n16:11\n\nKC: Fans who had the 5G phone were able to, right from the beginning, take their phone and pan it around the room and you'd immediately see different lighting, different things coming to life, and making the arena itself come to life in three dimensional ways that obviously were not there in reality. They were only there in mixed reality. We had a very specific song, the band chose Call You Mine. And the other feature that we had to add was a countdown clock so everybody knew that the song and experience was going to happen for those several minutes that the song came to life on that phone. And part of that experience, if you saw it, there's kind of broken glass pieces with a three dimensional face that sort of comes to life. And one of the fun features that fans were able to do if they were\n\n17:00\n\nsitting next to each other, I'd have the ability to flick a broken piece of glass, for example. And that would end up on your screen. And again, only way to accomplish that would be through 5G. We couldn't be a half a second off from the words that were coming out of the artists' mouths and the notes that were triggering different things happening. So, I'm sure to the naked eye, I think everybody thought it was amazing. I think for all the engineers in the tech team behind the scenes, we knew how specific we had to be. And it was just incredibly rewarding.\n\n17:34\n\nCW: I love that. And I love that you were playing with things that fans might not even have known that they were able to take advantage of, but you were just kind of pushing the boundaries just to see what was possible. I want to ask you, having like the artists' full cooperation, how important was that to getting the experience right?\n\nKC: I would say critically important. To be honest with you, we would have only worked forward with an artist like a Chainsmokers, who actually understood what we were trying to accomplish. And that was really fun.\n\n18:00\n\nThey're very tech forward thinking. And immediately when we mentioned the opportunity to them, they lit up and they were excited. And they immediately knew they wanted to do it to the Call You Mine song because they knew the creative they had already built... Yeah, look, authenticity is everything in our business. So in order to have authenticity, you certainly need the artists because they're the creative geniuses. We're just, hopefully, folks that can bring the creative to life.\n\n18:25\n\nCW: Yeah, well, you're, you're the conduits, which is, which is really important. I actually want to ask you because you were talking about, you know, the fan response and being authentic, what was the fan response to the Chainsmokers experience?\n\nKC: If you spent any money and you were going to go see the band, you probably like them already. So that's always a nice advantage to have. But to have something fun and experience in a different way. I mean, let's face it, more people are capturing and sharing things on a mobile device now at live events than they ever have.\n\nCW: Totally.\n\nKC: And so creating something different that somebody else doesn't have, you can see it every day that people are challenging themselves\n\n19:00\n\ncreatively on their own, to have the best picture, the best angle, the best moment, the best close up.\n\nCW: Yeah, no, you bring up a great point because I was just thinking, so many concerts that I go to now I do in some ways, I have to kind of remind myself, I'm like, \"Okay, put your phone down.\" You know, because I'm, I'm trying to capture video and photos and whatnot. But if you're adding this new experience where you're going to get a different perspective than just the same video or photo, or whatever that thousands of other people in the crowd have too, then that really adds something special to the experience.\n\n19:30\n\nKC: I think that was one of our takeaways that we didn't even fully realize until it was over was that moment that we realized, \"Wow, could we be creating something that could be a keepsake that only the live fan gets to experience?\" Obviously, that works great with the Live Nation business. But are we really giving something that's special and unique, which is difficult to do in a world where again, everybody's snapping the same photos all over the place. And we don't mind people having FOMO and wanting to go to the show, right? So if you could share that,\n\n20:00\n\nthat's only helping the Chainsmokers promote this amazing concert and showing that they're on the cutting edge. So there was just a lot of positivity that came out of that, that, that we didn't even anticipate to be honest with you, when when we started.\n\nCW: So looking forward, where do you think live music is heading in the coming years? And how does 5G play into that?\n\n20:19\n\nKC: Just the basics, quite frankly, of the connectivity is a, is, it's a real pain point in any live entertainment, you know, including sports or an NFL game, or whatever it may be. So just the raw connectivity, you'd be surprised how incredibly rewarding just that piece is. And so now the key is for us to, to think about those things that are, you know, new experiences that we could have, right? Because I could deliver a mixed reality experience in an app without 5G. But what I can't do without 5G is simultaneously experience that with you, right? So that's a really important piece of the puzzle and starts to unlock other ideas you might have. For example, do we have the setlist in real time coming at you\n\n21:00\n\nfrom the left side of your eyesight?\n\nCW: Yeah...\n\nKC: And, when you walk into the building, maybe all the posters come to life from all the histories that put, you know, I've just given you some, like easy examples of things,\n\nCW: Yeah!\n\nKC: That people could experience at the same time. And the other piece that we're, we're exploring is volumetrically capturing the artists themselves. So fans can experience up close with the artists without being with the artists and, and visually experiencing a volumetric video and taking a photo with them, or having a picture or having a video made with them. So you know, these are all things that were impossible.\n\n21:35\n\nCW: You know, it\u2019s interesting that you say that, because one thing that's happening right now is that musicians, who are mainly dependent on being with fans in a physical space, are now having to figure out not just how to substitute for that experience, but to... as you say, you know, kind of actually offer something that's different, and makes more sense for performing remotely.\n\nCW: You know, they have to do something that they haven't been able to do before.\n\n22:00\n\nKC: Yeah, yeah, it's been kind of funny to me a little bit, because we've been live streaming concerts for years. And so we enjoyed watching all the artists take matters in their own hands and creatively deliver. But you know, something happened real fast, right? There was so much of it, to your point, you know, \"How are you differentiating?\" started to become a creative conversation for artists, right? \"What am I doing differently that somebody else isn't doing?\" Now, there's also some really fun technology things that we've seen that we've been playing around with too that I think are special and, and taking a volumetric capture of an artist and inserting them in a fantastical world, with fans actually joining in, in that social media and connectivity to those moments, so... we're excited about it. I mean, we know that you can't replace that experience in the venue. But the idea that you could extend that reach to someone that may not be able to get to that venue, might be able to not afford to get to that venue, it's in another location... whatever the reason might be, the idea that we could extend a live concert experience to a fan who can't be there,\n\n23:00\n\nis something unique, and I don't think that's going away. And I, I could definitely share with you that we'll be spending a lot more time thinking about that, and exploring and executing ways to extend that reach for fans more than ever. And that part I think is actually something super positive that's gonna come out of this.\n\n23:15\n\nCW: Kevin, it was great talking with you. Thank you for sharing all of your insights and telling us about the amazing Chainsmokers experience. I hope that I can see you at a live show soon. Thanks so much.\n\nKC: Sounds good. Thanks again.\n\n23:29\n\nCW: So much of my life revolves around music. The fact that I can see and hear my favorite artists live, by just turning on my phone, has really helped me keep it together during some truly tough times. Verizon 5G can make that connection more interactive, more immersive, just more real. And when the stage doors open back up, I can't wait to see how all of these adaptations and innovations will go with us into the next era of live music.\n\n23:51\n\nCW: On the next episode of Networked, I'll find out what exactly goes on in a smart city. And explore the massive untapped potential that Verizon 5G can unlock\n\n24:00\n\nwhen it comes to first responders, transportation, and the next generation of maps.\n\nEN: And the time difference between you walking out into that crosswalk and that car zooming through and hitting you is probably seconds.\n\nCW: Yeah.\n\nEN: You need to know instantaneously, \u201cStop! Don't go any further,\u201d and the vehicle also needs to apply that brake immediately \u2014\n\n24:20\n\nCW: That\u2019s next time on Networked: The 5G Future, by Verizon and T Brand.

As a member of a family of 6, it\u2019s inevitable that we will not all agree on everything \u2026 One important thing to point out is the age gap between most parents and children. My dad being in his late 60\u2019s while I\u2019m in my late teens is a prime example. If my dad and I were to have different views, I would be confident on my own. After all, the results of this years election shape more of my future than his. Luckily my dad and I agree, and both want what is best for my future, however this is not the case for all families.

I choose to surround myself with people who have the same views as me, but I\u2019m still kind to my friends and family members who think differently.

I come from an extremely divided family where my parents are extremely republican, one sister is extremely liberal, the other is fairly moderate, and I am moderate, leaning towards the left side.

Sometimes her father, John, and brother, Thomas, accompanied her, but Bushell was the star, combining technical virtuosity with bright-eyed showmanship (and some enthusiastic yelling).\n\nThe sight of Bushell wailing away immediately impressed Dave Grohl, the Foo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer who played \u201cIn Bloom\u201d on the band\u2019s 1991 breakthrough album, \u201cNevermind.\u201d Grohl is not a social media user, and he only learned about the viral clip when the album\u2019s producer, Butch Vig, sent it to him.\n\n\u201cI watched it in amazement, not only because she was nailing all of the parts, but the way that she would scream when she did her drum rolls,\u201d Grohl said in a recent video interview. \u201cThere\u2019s something about seeing the joy and energy of a kid in love with an instrument. She just seemed like a force of nature.\u201d\n\nThat said, he experienced it like any piece of content \u2014 you watch it, you enjoy it, you pass it on and then move on. But toward the end of the summer, another one of Bushell\u2019s videos made its way to Grohl via a flood of texts from friends around the world. This time, Bushell had prefaced her cover of the 1997 Foo Fighters song \u201cEverlong\u201d with a direct challenge to a drum-off. The rules of a drum-off aren\u2019t formally sanctioned by any governing body, but Bushell\u2019s exhilarated facial expressions and mastery of the song\u2019s breakneck pace meant Grohl was in for a battle, should he choose to accept.\n\nIn a separate video interview, Bushell offered a very simple reason for why she decided to call out Grohl: \u201cHe\u2019s a drummer, \u2019cause he drummed in quite a few bands, so why not?\u201d Bushell is 10 years old, and the clarity of her logic \u2014 her favorite word might be \u201cepic\u201d \u2014 was blessedly refreshing. Grohl is her favorite drummer, and when asked why, she answered, \u201cHe thrashes the kit really hard, which I like.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Grohl is also a married father of three gearing up to release Foo Fighters\u2019 10th studio album, \u201cMedicine at Midnight,\u201d in February, which corresponds with the band\u2019s 25th anniversary. \u201cThe one thing we hadn\u2019t really ever done was a danceable party record, and those two things used in the same sentence as the Foo Fighters could be really terrifying,\u201d he said, before citing dance albums by rock artists, such as David Bowie\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Dance\u201d and the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cTattoo You.\u201d", "This all started last spring, when virus fears, mounting unemployment and the loneliness of digital life combined to create a perfect environment for online romantic scams. These women didn\u2019t strike me as being especially gullible; they were just looking for love from the confines of their homes like so many others.\n\nI had been single for years following a divorce. A stranger glancing at my photos may have seen someone trying to look happy. But as one woman from Nebraska wrote, \u201cYou\u2019ve got sad eyes.\u201d\n\nThey were generous in letting me know about the scams, but their messages held complicated layers. For months, each woman had built something with this fake me, and in the wake of the scam\u2019s collapse, the real me was all that was left to absorb their bitterness and provide what they hadn\u2019t yet received \u2014 honesty.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t hard for me to relate.

That experience devastated me but also helped me understand all too well how these women could fall for a stranger online, and how he could use their hope against them.\n\nI told them I was sorry that someone using my photos had caused them so much pain.

Extracurricular clubs and birthday parties are mostly canceled. So are rites of passage like prom and homecoming. Students spend vast portions of their weeks staring at Zoom screens. Without school events and traditions to anticipate, many say they are struggling to get out of bed in the morning.\n\n\u201cEverything is stagnant now,\u201d said Ayden Hufford, 15, a high school sophomore in Rye, a suburban area north of New York City, whose school now has blended in-person and remote learning. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to look forward to.

But with restaurants still serving customers in the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration faces a now-familiar conundrum: As the virus gains ground, should dining rooms be shuttered before classrooms?\n\nThe question reflects the complicated calculus that the pandemic has foisted onto cities all over the world, asking officials to balance livelihoods against lives, and to weigh the survival of today\u2019s economy against the education of a generation of children.\n\nThere are no simple trade-offs, and it is possible that both schools and indoor dining will close in the coming days or weeks.

In New Hampshire, the percentage of suicides occurring after recent gun purchases has declined slightly in recent years, although researchers say the drop cannot be clearly attributed to Gun Shop Project initiatives.\n\nResearch on legal restrictions on firearms is more plentiful. A new handgun law in Connecticut that requires a permit before a firearm purchase has been associated with a 15 percent reduction of gun suicides in that state, while the repeal of permit-to-purchase laws in Missouri has been associated with a similar increase in firearm suicides, a study found. State laws prohibiting the sale of firearms to youth were associated with a modest decrease in suicides among those aged 14 to 20, one study found.

Send help.\u201d\n\nCW: What pops into your head?\n\nCW: You\u2019re probably thinking of firefighters sliding down poles, or maybe a fire truck, racing out of the station, sirens blaring.\n\nCW: You\u2019re probably not picturing a bunch of firefighters just hanging out in the back of that truck, stuck, in midday traffic.\n\n00:26\n\nNN: Cars were unable to move out of their way in order for them to arrive on the scene, and so traffic is still one of the number one complaints in many cities across the country. It doesn't matter where you come from, you think your traffic is pretty bad in your local city, and so we know that local governments, uh, are absolutely trying to figure out: how do they improve, traffic in their cities.\n\nCW: That's Nick Nilan, Director of Public Sector Product Development at Verizon.\n\nCW: He\u2019s spent time with firefighters, and learned that they tend to know their local streets better than anyone else in the community.\n\nCW: But once they're\n\n01:00\n\non those streets, they don't have many other tools to get them to the fire as quickly as possible \u2014 or know what to expect once they get there.\n\nNN: They use commercial navigation systems that we use on our smartphones.

They knew exactly what the building's address was. But on the way to the scene, the feedback that the firefighters gave me was that they sit in the, the engine on the way to the building. They don't always know exactly what the traffic looks like for them and so they gave me examples of times where they ran into traffic problems.\n\nNN: And all they could do was sit there.\n\nCW: This is Networked: The 5G Future, a podcast from Verizon and T Brand. I'm Christina Warren. As a reporter and analyst\n\n02:00\n\nI've spent years covering how technology changes the way we work, play and connect online. Throughout the series, I'm learning how this new generation of wireless technology could pave the way for some major advances in every part of our lives, from education, to healthcare, to music. In this episode, I'm learning about improvements to how we map our cities and towns, and how 5G could make this space around us more responsive to our real time needs.\n\nCW: When I spoke to Nick Nilan about the challenges that firefighters have to overcome, I was thinking about traffic flow and how quickly first responders need to move from Point A to Point B. But Nick showed me that a lot of what he deals with is information flow and helping first responders and their dispatchers improve what he calls, \"situational awareness.\"\n\nNN: Situational awareness is essentially knowing what's going on around you in every possible way, whether it's before you arrive on scene, or when you're already on scene, of knowing what's happening. And we think about it\n\n03:00\n\nin two ways. One is more situational awareness for that first responder. How do we get them more information if they need it or want it at that moment. And then also, how do we get that information back to their headquarters or back to a dispatcher so that as the situation changes, they can change their response.\n\nCW: For a firefighter, this information can include structural details about the building that's on fire, and what's going on with the people inside and around the building.\n\nNN: Are there crowds out front? Is there a commotion out front that's gonna impact the ability to, to arrive on scene effectively. Where is the local fire hydrant? Is that blocked? Are there flames already coming out of the building? Is there smoke that's visible?\n\nCW: Every emergency is unique. And every second matters. So the thought that a team of firefighters could be sitting in traffic, waiting to get onto the scene before they can come up with a plan of action, sets off all kinds of alarm bells for Nick.\n\n04:00\n\nNN: We know we can arrive on scene with more information. We know there's down time in the engine. And so how do we make sure that we can leverage the information, we can get it into the hands of our first responders before they arrive on scene?\n\nCW: Then, once firefighters do reach the scene, there are innovative tech tools that help them do the job \u2014 like infrared cameras, or augmented reality displays.\n\nCW: But for now, these tools aren't really portable or reliable enough for them to depend on.\n\nNN: The, the only two ways that they have today of actually navigating a smoke-filled building is either with their hands, and actually feeling the walls of the building to be able to move forward. Or with a handheld device that shows where there's walls, where there's potential victims, where there's hot spots. But it's a pretty heavy device that they bring into the, the fire itself. And then lastly, the solution around augmented reality or heads-up displays, that's possible today, but the problem is, is you need a lot of\n\n05:00\n\nlocal compute to be able to support many of the heads-up displays and augmented reality that exists today. These are items where we are in discussions with fire departments across the country, fire fighters of every rank, to talk about how do we leverage technology in the right ways to improve these critical areas of the response.\n\nCW: A 5G network could lead to major breakthroughs in how first responders, or just regular people with smartphones, navigate our cities or towns. To look into the future of 5G-enabled cities, I called Elise Neel, Vice President of New Business Incubation at Verizon.\n\nEN: My team houses industry experts in location technology, in aerial and terrestrial robotics, aviation services, digital space management, and a bunch of other emergent technologies. Ultimately, our responsibility is to look into a crystal ball. So what are we doing to uncover the unmet, unknown needs of customers\n\n06:00\n\nthree to 10 years from now?\n\nCW: Before we got into the weeds, I thought it would help to just step back and understand the basics. After all, 5G is the fifth generation of wireless. So I asked to Elise what could make it different from the past four networks that we've come to rely on.\n\nEN: If you go back and you think about 1G, way back in the day, 1G gave us kind of mobile phones. It gave us the ability to have a conversation and audio components over a network. 2G introduced text messaging. So now we have audio and we have text. 3G is like the Palm Pilot, BlackBerry generation. So that began to put the internet into our pockets. And 4G made all of that fast enough for mobile applications, right? It really is the on-demand, higher data rate, and kind of real time personalization of the internet.\n\nCW: It's funny, because actually, when I think back on my past phones, and what's happened over the years, what I most remember is that stuff has gotten faster. I've been able to download more things. And I know that 5G\n\n07:00\n\nis being rolled out across the country right now. And it's going to take some time to build on the new network. So now could we fast forward and talk about the future state of 5G in cities? Like, let's paint a picture of what kind of changes we could potentially look forward to and what will stand out from what we've experienced in the past.\n\nEN: So 5G isn't just kind of the next \"G\" on your phone. In addition to massive speeds, and massive throughput, it also brings additional capabilities, a massive impact on how we live, how we learn and how we work and play. So your next question would be, \"That sounds great. Like, what are these additional capabilities?\"\n\nCW: Exactly.\n\nEN: So some of them, right, so some of them are energy efficiency. So this is the ability\n\nfor the network to use 90% less power than it currently does today. I don't know about you, but like, charging my devices every night, I forget it all the time. And so I think about those problems potentially going away. Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband allows you to maintain a sticky connection at 350 miles per hour. It is\n\n08:00\n\nmind blowing.\n\nCW: Wow.\n\nEN: And I just, I'm dying to talk to NASCAR and Formula 1 to say, \"How is this going to transform the game?\" I think it's going to be profound. I think about ultra low latency. So five milliseconds of latency across the network. It's about 100 times faster than the blink of an eye. I don't know if you're getting it, but I'm super excited because this isn't just another step function. It is something kind of altogether new. We really see 5G providing this technical backbone for the future to draw upon. It ultimately is an invitation to kind of explore and to innovate, which is what we're just so excited about here.\n\nCW: And what, what got you interested in your field of work?\n\nEN: Ultimately, I believe my superpower is that I'm a builder, and I'm incessantly curious. But I'm not the girl who took apart her computer in the '80s to kind of find out how it worked inside. Instead, I'm the girl who studied dance and art and have found that this discovery in kind of the\n\n09:00\n\nintermixing of the humanities and technology has created this sweet spot for me.\n\nCW: I do have to ask you, do you still dance?\n\nEN: I do. So I'm a former professional tap dancer.\n\nCW: Wow.\n\nEN: Music, uh, music makes me go. So, yes.\n\nCW: That's awesome. Shifting gears a little bit, although I, you know what, I think that we could say that dance could be a form of transportation, at least if you do it the right way.\n\nEN: I like that. Yes.\n\nCW: But, but when someone thinks about transportation getting smarter, especially around cities, what do you think that they're talking about?\n\nEN: Protection, personalization, and play. When we think about protection, I would say first it's about this kind of near real time data transmission that's going to promote enhanced public safety and security. So when I think about our first responders, they're going to get that vital information about incidents, and know whether personnel is en route or already on site. These innovations also help cities manage energy and control carbon emissions. So when we think about protection,\n\n10:00\n\nkind of this first category, it is both protecting humans and assisting our treasured first responders, as well as kind of the assets that, that we have been given, you know, as a part of Mother Earth. And outside of protection, I then think about personalization. What does the city need to do so that Christina can have the best citywide experience? And so in those customizations around: Where do you park? How do you get most easily to your destination? And how do we come up with a suite of services that addresses your needs, Christina, as you come into the city, as well as millions of others? And then ultimately, why do we like to come to cities? We come to cities to work, but we also come to play. Ultimately, if I go back to my roots, the most exciting thing is when I go to a live performance, a live concert of sorts. I want the opportunity to engage with the artist, and with the dancers, and with the performance, and with the backstories. Who was the choreographer? And what are those dance moves? And can I learn them by myself at home? I want to understand who created that costume.\n\n11:00\n\nI now can sit and explore and engage with my friends, and with those around me, and with other fans, and all that's kind of coming to life. So protection, personalization, and play. I think this 5G automated city has a lot to offer.\n\nCW: But, when we think about some of the broader challenges, you know, just affecting transportation, traffic, all the ways we get around, then what kind of impact could we expect from 5G?\n\nEN: I think about the accuracy front in particular. It will accelerate this vehicle to everything communication. And so I would hold loosely the term, \"vehicle,\" because we're talking about machines truly.\n\nCW: Right.\n\nEN: I think about these machines kind of giving them sight. So just like how you and I see and interpret and then decision in real time. When I'm walking towards you on the street, I decide whether or not I want to run into you, move to the right, move to the left, or give you a hug. If you believe that we will have a world where humans and machines truly interact and live cohesively together, we need to provide that situational awareness.\n\n12:00\n\nCW: I have to say like, I have a personal experience. Not long after I moved to Seattle, I was crossing the street, and a car just came sailing through and hit me.\n\nEN: Oh, no.\n\nCW: And I, I was hit.\n\nEN: Oh my gosh.\n\nCW: Yeah, and I was hit by a car. I was literally thrown under a bus. Fortunately it was parked. It was stopped, so that was lucky. I, I only broke my wrist. And you know, and I, I was okay, all things considered. But I think about that all the time. And every time I cross the street, I'm always, you know, super hyper aware of like, what's going on around me.\n\nEN: Well, first, that is a horrific experience. And so I'm sorry that you had to go through it. But it really does give an accurate example, like a real life human example, of some of the problems that we're facing as we have densification of cities, densification of our population. We've got to just orient ourselves a better together. In the time difference between you walking out into that crosswalk, and that car zooming through and, and hitting you, is probably seconds.\n\nCW: Yeah.\n\nEN: This is where we get to that five milliseconds of low latency, that hundred times faster than a blink of an eye. You need to know\n\n13:00\n\ninstantaneously, \"Stop! Don't, don't go any further.\" And the vehicle also needs to apply that brake immediately, because the way that you and I decision in our brains is also slower than five milliseconds of latency, right?\n\nCW: Right.\n\nEN: How do we have those override functions over the network so that the network can help us stay safer? So it begins to apply the brakes to the vehicle immediately. And it also communicates to your phone in real time, \"Stop now!\" with a vibration or a large alert that says, \"This is not safe any longer to cross. Just hold right there for a second. And then we'll deal with the speeding car.\"\n\nCW: Yeah.\n\nEN: So I think about low latency. And I think about all of that data being processed with massive amounts of people and pedestrians and bicycles and those barriers, as well as the vehicles, all coordinating and talking to one another together. We have an opportunity to get there faster, and to get the information that we need in a more readily available way.\n\nCW: Alright Elise, that was amazing. I learned so much. And I will talk to you later and like keep dancing, right?\n\nEN: Thanks so much. We'll speak soon.\n\n14:00\n\nCW: As the world around us becomes more interconnected through 5G, we have the chance to go from seeing information on our phones about buildings and streets, to interacting with these spaces in a way that's tailored to each of us individually. But what kind of mapping technology do we need to make that kind of interaction not only possible, but completely normal? I'll find out after the break.\n\nMidroll ad: Verizon 5G Edge is the world's first mobile edge computing platform with AWS Wavelength. And it's rolling out in select cities around the country. It's built right so faster speed and ultra low latency now come to mobile and connected devices paving the way for a wide range of transformative applications. The implications for rapid innovation are staggering. And now businesses and developers can harness its power today and into the future. Verizon 5G Edge is here, from the network businesses rely on.\n\n15:00\n\nCW: Nick Nilan and Elise Neel helped me understand the future possibilities of navigation on a 5G network. And if we're going to realize these possibilities, we're going to need a fundamentally new kind of map.\n\nHU: Really, a map is, is a cube. And so that technology disruption is happening today with more and more data, more and more complex geometry, and digital representation of the world. And all of this changes radically the space of location technology.\n\nCW: That's Herve Utheza, the Chief of Data Strategy at HERE Technologies. HERE is using Verizon's 5G network and mobile edge computing platform to remake the building blocks of digital mapping.\n\nHU: Our mission is to really bring improvement in location intelligence, by way of a better geometry of the world, a more precise geometry of the world. For example, the\n\n16:00\n\nstreet signs that one day will be able to be all modified on demand to ensure that this ambulance is able to find what we call in the industry, \"the green wave,\" which means the wave of all the green lights that can be triggered automatically, to modify the traffic around the city and make the city less congested, safer, and, and functioning better.\n\nCW: Okay, so just to be clear, how exactly are we defining location intelligence?\n\nHU: When you talk about location intelligence, you're really talking about two pieces of, of defining location data. There is geometry data of the world. And that will be what people think of traditionally as the map. And then there's the movement of the objects of the world.\n\nCW: So when you say geometry data, I'm understanding that to mean a map of the world, right? So for HERE Technologies, where does that data come from? And what's different about how you gather it?\n\nHU: It's an endeavor. We are the largest\n\n17:00\n\naggregator of geometry data. We have more than 100,000 data sources. We work with many, many company in the industry. We collect our own data. We have a fleet of cars that are equipped with lasers. We drive the world. We make digital models of the world. And we do that at scale across 200 countries.\n\nCW: And circling back, you also mentioned the movement of objects. Tell me more about that. How does movement data work with geometry data? And what does that achieve?\n\nHU: Well, you can have a movement of a phone. You can have the movement of a crate on a truck, but you don't know where it is. That location data is really a set of coordinates that needs to be matched to what is around you. And this is where the geometry of the world comes into play. Now you can actually know whether the truck made a stop at this Shell or Chevron station. You know whether the bridge height that the truck is going to go\n\n18:00\n\nunder is too low for the truck and therefore you need to reroute the truck because you could break both the truck and the bridge.\n\nCW: So when you talk about object detection or collision avoidance, how does 5G help with those solutions?\n\nHU: Well, we have not only talked about it, but we have also proven it with our friends at Verizon. And, and we have showcased some proof of concepts from projects to integrate the 5G network to a car that is using a phone. And it's a small piece of software that is able to recognize what's on the road. It recognizes a car. It recognizes a pedestrian, a human passing. It recognizes a construction cone. And that recognition then sends the message to the network over the 5G link. And the network will then send back an alert message with millisecond latency into the driving or moving object. But now\n\n19:00\n\nimagine that you want to send an alert to other 5G Verizon network-powered objects. And now you're getting into a collision avoidance micro community, if you will, that is able to be self sustaining. So ultimately, 5G and location come together to bring more safety in a, in a micro location sense of the term. All of this can happen in a very localized part of the network.\n\nCW: Okay, so as you've been working hands-on with Verizon 5G, what are the new developments that get you excited? Like, what's one way that we'll start to see the capabilities of this 5G network start to change our day-to-day lives?\n\nHU: We'll see it when we start seeing a, a phone maker actually put a front facing camera at the edge of the phone, not at the back face of the phone, but at the edge because people have a tendency to walk around with their phone in their hand, horizontal.\n\n20:00\n\nImagine now that you actually see a camera facing you. And suddenly you see the world superimposed with augmented reality powered by 5G. Because now suddenly, you have very low latency, you can recognize the world. You can turn around your hand very, very easily. That is from a consumer perspective, from an individual perspective, going to open up completely novel ways to think about what the map and the world actually is. Now, suddenly, your phone, instead of looking at it in your hand, you start pointing the camera, and you put your phone upwards and you look at the world.\n\nCW: Okay? That's really futuristic, and I love it.\n\nHU: I'll leave you with that. But ultimately, the moment when you start having super imposition of information to what you see, suddenly reality start taking a new shape. It's no longer going to be what your eye sees. But it's what your phone, your favorite application, your\n\n21:00\n\nfavorite social app enables you to know about the world around you.\n\nCW: Herve, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.\n\nHU: Thank you, Christina for having me. It was a pleasure sharing with you a little bit about technology, location and 5G.\n\nCW: This transition from a 2D map that happens to be on a phone, to a 3D map that's continuously connected to everything around us, is revolutionary. It's also part of a bigger change that Verizon 5G could bring to our cities and towns. Connecting us more deeply to the places where we live, work, and thrive.\n\nCW: You can listen to every episode of Networked: The 5G Future wherever you get your podcasts. And if you want to know more about how innovators are exploring how to harness the power of Verizon 5G, check out the new documentary, Speed of Thought, on Amazon Prime Video or SpeedofThoughtFilm.com.\n\nCW: I'm Christina Warren.

And then lastly, the solution around augmented reality or heads-up displays, that's possible today, but the problem is, is you need a lot of\n\n05:00\n\nlocal compute to be able to support many of the heads-up displays and augmented reality that exists today. These are items where we are in discussions with fire departments across the country, fire fighters of every rank, to talk about how do we leverage technology in the right ways to improve these critical areas of the response.\n\nCW: A 5G network could lead to major breakthroughs in how first responders, or just regular people with smartphones, navigate our cities or towns. To look into the future of 5G-enabled cities, I called Elise Neel, Vice President of New Business Incubation at Verizon.\n\nEN: My team houses industry experts in location technology, in aerial and terrestrial robotics, aviation services, digital space management, and a bunch of other emergent technologies. Ultimately, our responsibility is to look into a crystal ball. So what are we doing to uncover the unmet, unknown needs of customers\n\n06:00\n\nthree to 10 years from now?\n\nCW: Before we got into the weeds, I thought it would help to just step back and understand the basics. After all, 5G is the fifth generation of wireless. So I asked to Elise what could make it different from the past four networks that we've come to rely on.\n\nEN: If you go back and you think about 1G, way back in the day, 1G gave us kind of mobile phones. It gave us the ability to have a conversation and audio components over a network. 2G introduced text messaging. So now we have audio and we have text. 3G is like the Palm Pilot, BlackBerry generation. So that began to put the internet into our pockets. And 4G made all of that fast enough for mobile applications, right? It really is the on-demand, higher data rate, and kind of real time personalization of the internet.\n\nCW: It's funny, because actually, when I think back on my past phones, and what's happened over the years, what I most remember is that stuff has gotten faster. I've been able to download more things. And I know that 5G\n\n07:00\n\nis being rolled out across the country right now. And it's going to take some time to build on the new network. So now could we fast forward and talk about the future state of 5G in cities? Like, let's paint a picture of what kind of changes we could potentially look forward to and what will stand out from what we've experienced in the past.\n\nEN: So 5G isn't just kind of the next \"G\" on your phone. In addition to massive speeds, and massive throughput, it also brings additional capabilities, a massive impact on how we live, how we learn and how we work and play. So your next question would be, \"That sounds great. Like, what are these additional capabilities?\"\n\nCW: Exactly.\n\nEN: So some of them, right, so some of them are energy efficiency. So this is the ability\n\nfor the network to use 90% less power than it currently does today. I don't know about you, but like, charging my devices every night, I forget it all the time. And so I think about those problems potentially going away. Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband allows you to maintain a sticky connection at 350 miles per hour. It is\n\n08:00\n\nmind blowing.\n\nCW: Wow.\n\nEN: And I just, I'm dying to talk to NASCAR and Formula 1 to say, \"How is this going to transform the game?\" I think it's going to be profound. I think about ultra low latency. So five milliseconds of latency across the network. It's about 100 times faster than the blink of an eye. I don't know if you're getting it, but I'm super excited because this isn't just another step function. It is something kind of altogether new. We really see 5G providing this technical backbone for the future to draw upon. It ultimately is an invitation to kind of explore and to innovate, which is what we're just so excited about here.\n\nCW: And what, what got you interested in your field of work?\n\nEN: Ultimately, I believe my superpower is that I'm a builder, and I'm incessantly curious. But I'm not the girl who took apart her computer in the '80s to kind of find out how it worked inside. Instead, I'm the girl who studied dance and art and have found that this discovery in kind of the\n\n09:00\n\nintermixing of the humanities and technology has created this sweet spot for me.\n\nCW: I do have to ask you, do you still dance?\n\nEN: I do. So I'm a former professional tap dancer.\n\nCW: Wow.\n\nEN: Music, uh, music makes me go. So, yes.\n\nCW: That's awesome. Shifting gears a little bit, although I, you know what, I think that we could say that dance could be a form of transportation, at least if you do it the right way.\n\nEN: I like that. Yes.\n\nCW: But, but when someone thinks about transportation getting smarter, especially around cities, what do you think that they're talking about?\n\nEN: Protection, personalization, and play. When we think about protection, I would say first it's about this kind of near real time data transmission that's going to promote enhanced public safety and security. So when I think about our first responders, they're going to get that vital information about incidents, and know whether personnel is en route or already on site. These innovations also help cities manage energy and control carbon emissions. So when we think about protection,\n\n10:00\n\nkind of this first category, it is both protecting humans and assisting our treasured first responders, as well as kind of the assets that, that we have been given, you know, as a part of Mother Earth. And outside of protection, I then think about personalization. What does the city need to do so that Christina can have the best citywide experience? And so in those customizations around: Where do you park? How do you get most easily to your destination? And how do we come up with a suite of services that addresses your needs, Christina, as you come into the city, as well as millions of others? And then ultimately, why do we like to come to cities? We come to cities to work, but we also come to play. Ultimately, if I go back to my roots, the most exciting thing is when I go to a live performance, a live concert of sorts. I want the opportunity to engage with the artist, and with the dancers, and with the performance, and with the backstories. Who was the choreographer? And what are those dance moves? And can I learn them by myself at home? I want to understand who created that costume.\n\n11:00\n\nI now can sit and explore and engage with my friends, and with those around me, and with other fans, and all that's kind of coming to life. So protection, personalization, and play. I think this 5G automated city has a lot to offer.\n\nCW: But, when we think about some of the broader challenges, you know, just affecting transportation, traffic, all the ways we get around, then what kind of impact could we expect from 5G?\n\nEN: I think about the accuracy front in particular. It will accelerate this vehicle to everything communication. And so I would hold loosely the term, \"vehicle,\" because we're talking about machines truly.\n\nCW: Right.\n\nEN: I think about these machines kind of giving them sight. So just like how you and I see and interpret and then decision in real time. When I'm walking towards you on the street, I decide whether or not I want to run into you, move to the right, move to the left, or give you a hug. If you believe that we will have a world where humans and machines truly interact and live cohesively together, we need to provide that situational awareness.\n\n12:00\n\nCW: I have to say like, I have a personal experience. Not long after I moved to Seattle, I was crossing the street, and a car just came sailing through and hit me.\n\nEN: Oh, no.\n\nCW: And I, I was hit.\n\nEN: Oh my gosh.\n\nCW: Yeah, and I was hit by a car. I was literally thrown under a bus. Fortunately it was parked. It was stopped, so that was lucky. I, I only broke my wrist. And you know, and I, I was okay, all things considered. But I think about that all the time. And every time I cross the street, I'm always, you know, super hyper aware of like, what's going on around me.\n\nEN: Well, first, that is a horrific experience. And so I'm sorry that you had to go through it. But it really does give an accurate example, like a real life human example, of some of the problems that we're facing as we have densification of cities, densification of our population. We've got to just orient ourselves a better together. In the time difference between you walking out into that crosswalk, and that car zooming through and, and hitting you, is probably seconds.\n\nCW: Yeah.\n\nEN: This is where we get to that five milliseconds of low latency, that hundred times faster than a blink of an eye. You need to know\n\n13:00\n\ninstantaneously, \"Stop! Don't, don't go any further.\" And the vehicle also needs to apply that brake immediately, because the way that you and I decision in our brains is also slower than five milliseconds of latency, right?\n\nCW: Right.\n\nEN: How do we have those override functions over the network so that the network can help us stay safer? So it begins to apply the brakes to the vehicle immediately. And it also communicates to your phone in real time, \"Stop now!\" with a vibration or a large alert that says, \"This is not safe any longer to cross. Just hold right there for a second. And then we'll deal with the speeding car.\"\n\nCW: Yeah.\n\nEN: So I think about low latency. And I think about all of that data being processed with massive amounts of people and pedestrians and bicycles and those barriers, as well as the vehicles, all coordinating and talking to one another together. We have an opportunity to get there faster, and to get the information that we need in a more readily available way.\n\nCW: Alright Elise, that was amazing. I learned so much. And I will talk to you later and like keep dancing, right?\n\nEN: Thanks so much. We'll speak soon.\n\n14:00\n\nCW: As the world around us becomes more interconnected through 5G, we have the chance to go from seeing information on our phones about buildings and streets, to interacting with these spaces in a way that's tailored to each of us individually. But what kind of mapping technology do we need to make that kind of interaction not only possible, but completely normal? I'll find out after the break.\n\nMidroll ad: Verizon 5G Edge is the world's first mobile edge computing platform with AWS Wavelength. And it's rolling out in select cities around the country. It's built right so faster speed and ultra low latency now come to mobile and connected devices paving the way for a wide range of transformative applications. The implications for rapid innovation are staggering. And now businesses and developers can harness its power today and into the future. Verizon 5G Edge is here, from the network businesses rely on.\n\n15:00\n\nCW: Nick Nilan and Elise Neel helped me understand the future possibilities of navigation on a 5G network. And if we're going to realize these possibilities, we're going to need a fundamentally new kind of map.\n\nHU: Really, a map is, is a cube. And so that technology disruption is happening today with more and more data, more and more complex geometry, and digital representation of the world. And all of this changes radically the space of location technology.\n\nCW: That's Herve Utheza, the Chief of Data Strategy at HERE Technologies. HERE is using Verizon's 5G network and mobile edge computing platform to remake the building blocks of digital mapping.\n\nHU: Our mission is to really bring improvement in location intelligence, by way of a better geometry of the world, a more precise geometry of the world. For example, the\n\n16:00\n\nstreet signs that one day will be able to be all modified on demand to ensure that this ambulance is able to find what we call in the industry, \"the green wave,\" which means the wave of all the green lights that can be triggered automatically, to modify the traffic around the city and make the city less congested, safer, and, and functioning better.\n\nCW: Okay, so just to be clear, how exactly are we defining location intelligence?\n\nHU: When you talk about location intelligence, you're really talking about two pieces of, of defining location data. There is geometry data of the world. And that will be what people think of traditionally as the map. And then there's the movement of the objects of the world.\n\nCW: So when you say geometry data, I'm understanding that to mean a map of the world, right? So for HERE Technologies, where does that data come from? And what's different about how you gather it?\n\nHU: It's an endeavor. We are the largest\n\n17:00\n\naggregator of geometry data. We have more than 100,000 data sources. We work with many, many company in the industry. We collect our own data. We have a fleet of cars that are equipped with lasers. We drive the world. We make digital models of the world. And we do that at scale across 200 countries.\n\nCW: And circling back, you also mentioned the movement of objects. Tell me more about that. How does movement data work with geometry data? And what does that achieve?\n\nHU: Well, you can have a movement of a phone. You can have the movement of a crate on a truck, but you don't know where it is. That location data is really a set of coordinates that needs to be matched to what is around you. And this is where the geometry of the world comes into play. Now you can actually know whether the truck made a stop at this Shell or Chevron station. You know whether the bridge height that the truck is going to go\n\n18:00\n\nunder is too low for the truck and therefore you need to reroute the truck because you could break both the truck and the bridge.\n\nCW: So when you talk about object detection or collision avoidance, how does 5G help with those solutions?\n\nHU: Well, we have not only talked about it, but we have also proven it with our friends at Verizon. And, and we have showcased some proof of concepts from projects to integrate the 5G network to a car that is using a phone. And it's a small piece of software that is able to recognize what's on the road. It recognizes a car. It recognizes a pedestrian, a human passing. It recognizes a construction cone. And that recognition then sends the message to the network over the 5G link. And the network will then send back an alert message with millisecond latency into the driving or moving object. But now\n\n19:00\n\nimagine that you want to send an alert to other 5G Verizon network-powered objects. And now you're getting into a collision avoidance micro community, if you will, that is able to be self sustaining. So ultimately, 5G and location come together to bring more safety in a, in a micro location sense of the term. All of this can happen in a very localized part of the network.\n\nCW: Okay, so as you've been working hands-on with Verizon 5G, what are the new developments that get you excited? Like, what's one way that we'll start to see the capabilities of this 5G network start to change our day-to-day lives?\n\nHU: We'll see it when we start seeing a, a phone maker actually put a front facing camera at the edge of the phone, not at the back face of the phone, but at the edge because people have a tendency to walk around with their phone in their hand, horizontal.\n\n20:00\n\nImagine now that you actually see a camera facing you. And suddenly you see the world superimposed with augmented reality powered by 5G. Because now suddenly, you have very low latency, you can recognize the world. You can turn around your hand very, very easily. That is from a consumer perspective, from an individual perspective, going to open up completely novel ways to think about what the map and the world actually is. Now, suddenly, your phone, instead of looking at it in your hand, you start pointing the camera, and you put your phone upwards and you look at the world.\n\nCW: Okay? That's really futuristic, and I love it.\n\nHU: I'll leave you with that. But ultimately, the moment when you start having super imposition of information to what you see, suddenly reality start taking a new shape. It's no longer going to be what your eye sees. But it's what your phone, your favorite application, your\n\n21:00\n\nfavorite social app enables you to know about the world around you.\n\nCW: Herve, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.\n\nHU: Thank you, Christina for having me. It was a pleasure sharing with you a little bit about technology, location and 5G.\n\nCW: This transition from a 2D map that happens to be on a phone, to a 3D map that's continuously connected to everything around us, is revolutionary. It's also part of a bigger change that Verizon 5G could bring to our cities and towns. Connecting us more deeply to the places where we live, work, and thrive.\n\nCW: You can listen to every episode of Networked: The 5G Future wherever you get your podcasts. And if you want to know more about how innovators are exploring how to harness the power of Verizon 5G, check out the new documentary, Speed of Thought, on Amazon Prime Video or SpeedofThoughtFilm.com.\n\nCW: I'm Christina Warren. Thanks for listening.\n\n22:00\n\nAd: Verizon just turned on 5G across the country with a coverage of 5G nationwide, and in more and more cities, the unprecedented performance of 5G Ultra Wideband, the fasted 5G in the world. 5G Ultra Wideband is so fast you can download an album in seconds. Verizon 5G won't just change how your phone works, it will change everything. This is the 5G America's been waiting for, only from Verizon. 5G Ultra Wideband available only in parts of select cities. 5G nationwide available in 1,800+ cities.

For example, a celebrity who has been accused of something like pedophilia is an appropriate reason to no longer support them, or \u201ccancel\u201d them. I also think it\u2019s ok to cancel someone in your own head, if you don\u2019t like who a certain person is and what they stand for, you don\u2019t need to interact with them. However I think some people get \u201ccanceled\u201d too quickly, and people are so quick to judge they won\u2019t even try to hear that person\u2019s side of the story.\n\n\u2014 Charley Vickery, Cary High School\n\nCalling someone out is shameful compared to calling someone in. People lose their jobs over being cancelled, without a chance to ever make amends or fix their actions, forever being locked away in a pool of hate. Imagine you want to stage an intervention.

Masterman, Philadelphia\n\nCancel Culture Is Inherently Problematic.\n\nI believe that it is essential to inform someone when their behavior has been insulting or disparaging, but Cancel Culture has brought this to an unnecessary extreme. Cancel Culture originates often from good intentions, but instead of explaining how a person\u2019s behavior has been harmful to others and allowing them the opportunity to learn from their mistakes, it ostracizes a person and can leave them with doubts and poor self esteem.\n\n\u2014 Sam R, FL\n\nCancel culture often ends up being personally attacked instead of constructively criticizing the person. Most of the time when someone gets canceled, doesn\u2019t even talk to them first before canceling them. Even in one of the stories in the article about the girl being canceled. None of her friends told her about why they canceled her, they just cut her out of her life. Cancel culture can also emotionally damage someone being cancelled. They often feel helpless and become depressed \u2026 An easy solution to fix cancel culture is to personally message someone if something is bothering you about them. Instead of just cutting that person out of your life.\n\n\u2014 Aaron D., IPoly High\n\nCancel culture, in our society today, has infested every bit of our lives. People are denounced and ridiculed for their actions years ago, or things they completely regret doing. Calling people out, and publicly shaming them is not the way, but it should be used as a time for education and reflection. By showing how they\u2019re actions are wrong, they can change to be a better person. When it comes to people you personally know, cancel culture is petty and ignorant. Just because you dislike someone, doesn\u2019t mean you have to ruin their life and turn everyone against them. Give them an opportunity to reconcile, and teach them the error of their ways. As for celebrities, just because of some horrendous and heinous acts, doesn\u2019t mean we have to rip all their good contributions to society too. Just because Michael Jackson did terrible things, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not the king of pop and we can\u2019t enjoy his music. It\u2019s like saying just because the founding fathers owned slaves, we can\u2019t live and thrive in America. I think Pete Davidson said it best when he said \u201cacting like these people never existed is not the solution\u201d and later said that \u201cevery time you watch a movie or listen to a song by a serial predator, donate a dollar to a charity that helps sexual assault.

Of course, I know that when people do or say something wrong, we should warn them and tell them that it\u2019s wrong \u2026 Cancelling is right when we try and make people acknowledge what they\u2019ve done wrong, but everything has a limit.\n\n\u2014 Clara Almeida, Escola Americana Do Recife, Brazil"], "20201119": ["[See a grid showing what\u2019s open and what\u2019s closed under each tier on the California Department of Public Health\u2019s website.| Look up where your county falls here.]\n\nAll that said, individual counties may impose more stringent restrictions than the state mandates.\n\nFor instance, officials in Los Angeles County \u2014 which has struggled for months with stubbornly high case loads \u2014 have said that the virus is spreading to dangerous and unsustainable levels.\n\nSo, effective Friday, the county is requiring that restaurants operate at half capacity, even outdoors.

Shark spotting there and in other places, when it occurs at all, is usually done by tracking tagged animals online, or by having someone stand on a paddle board in the water to keep an eye out.", "Through the pod, then, our kids are now a primary vector for contagion \u2014 putting not just my wife and me at risk, but also our parents, if we choose to see them. The map of my bubble makes this plain \u2014 if not for our children, my wife and I would be an island unto ourselves. But the thing about kids is, they\u2019re never alone \u2014 as Gurley pointed out, your friends and co-workers may live by themselves, but if you have kids, there\u2019s a good chance they associate with other kids, and you can be sure those kids are around other adults, creating an invisible chain between you and people you don\u2019t know.\n\nA lot of people, it turns out. Rebecca Green, the mom of one first grader in the pod, is a doctor who has daily contact with two colleagues and about 10 in-person patients a week. Green\u2019s younger son, the first grader\u2019s brother, attends a preschool with 10 other children and two teachers. Through this single connection, then, my kids are linked to at least two dozen other people, including a rotating cast of patients. Green told me that she thinks about this level of exposure often, and she outlined several mitigating factors. Her practice has \u201cstrict Covid rules around illness and anyone with even a cold has to have a negative Covid test to return to work,\u201d she told me. The preschool is also exceedingly careful. \u201cSomeone had a cold three months ago and everyone had to have a negative Covid test to return to preschool,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, for months, I\u2019ve been linked to two dozen strangers, just a few ill-timed coughs away from Covid, and all the while I\u2019d been none the wiser. As I was analyzing the far-flung corners of my bubble, I was often reminded of the double-dipping bit from \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d The dip looks untouched, pristine. But how many people are double-dipping their chips in your dip?\n\nSo that sealed the deal, then, right \u2014 we\u2019re staying home for Thanksgiving?\n\nWell, not so fast. Mapping the far reaches of my coronavirus bubble revealed far more contacts than I\u2019d expected, but there was something unexpectedly reassuring about candidly discussing Covid risks with Green and other parents. I discovered that my network is robust in ways that I hadn\u2019t anticipated. All of my indirect contacts are taking the virus seriously \u2014 none of them spun conspiracy theories about the pandemic, or suggested it was no big deal or told me to bug off and mind my own business. None of them were beyond risk, but I was also satisfied that they seemed to be doing the best they could to avoid getting sick.\n\nI asked Gurley if I was crazy to even consider visiting my family for the holidays. She told me I wasn\u2019t. In a pandemic, everyone is at some level of risk; what\u2019s important is understanding your risk, and deciding whether seeing your loved ones is worth it. \u201cI think we have to acknowledge the reality of people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my family, for example, we have a family member who has been diagnosed with stage-four cancer and may not live very long \u2014 so of course that person is at high risk, but at the same time, would we pass up the chance to see them in a way that we felt was safe?\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be going to Thanksgiving to see a family member dying of cancer. Mine is a more mundane desire \u2014 to see my folks in person in a year we\u2019ve spent mostly apart, and to accommodate their intense desire to spend time with our kids before the kids get too old for all that. This may not be enough to satisfy others\u2019 scrutiny \u2014 on social media, among lefties like myself who proudly believe in science and ostentatiously defer to expertise, I\u2019ve noticed quite a bit of travel-shaming. The C.D.C. says the safest way to spend Thanksgiving is to stay home. After discovering how huge my bubble is, shouldn\u2019t I just go with that advice?\n\nBut I can\u2019t do it. Even after I\u2019ve mapped my bubble, the question of whether or not to go still feels, in the end, like a gut call, ruled more by emotion than empirical data.", "\u201cI think we overuse that word \u2018trigger\u2019 when really we mean discomfort,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we should be able to have uncomfortable conversations.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe people should be publicly shamed for accidentally misgendering a classmate, which she once did, leading to a Title IX complaint that was later dismissed; for sending a stupid tweet they now regret; or for, say, admitting they once liked a piece of pop culture now viewed in a different light, such as \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it were on TV right now, I\u2019d watch the reruns,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really impatient with is calling people out for something they said when they were a teenager when they\u2019re now 55.

And I have to honestly ask: Why are you making choices to make the world crueler than it needs to be and calling that being \u2018woke\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe antidote to that outrage cycle, Professor Ross believes, is \u201ccalling in.\u201d Calling in is like calling out, but done privately and with respect. \u201cIt\u2019s a call out done with love,\u201d she said. That may mean simply sending someone a private message, or even ringing them on the telephone (!) to discuss the matter, or simply taking a breath before commenting, screen-shotting or demanding one \u201cdo better\u201d without explaining how.", "Our graphics department even debuted a new color \u2014 a dark purplish red \u2014 on The New York Times\u2019s online coronavirus case map to capture the record rates of infection.\n\nYet, in the face of this entirely anticipated crisis, Washington is doing very little.

Since Election Day, he\u2019s held one public event \u2014 an update on his administration\u2019s effort to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine. Other than traveling to his golf course, the president has remained holed up inside the White House.\n\nAt the same time, the government he leads has been offering mixed messages.\n\nOn Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Americans avoid traveling and gathering with relatives for the Thanksgiving holiday. And later in the day the White House coronavirus task force held its first news conference in months, urging Americans to remain vigilant as they wait for a vaccine. But on Wednesday, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, called some local guidelines limiting Thanksgiving gatherings \u201cOrwellian.\u201d (States that have imposed fewer virus containment measures now have the worst outbreaks, according to a New York Times analysis.)", "What\u2019s left to do when faced with a worst-case scenario?

Ridership may not reach 90 percent of pre-pandemic levels before 2024, according to the consulting giant McKinsey & Company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to match our service structure and service schedules to equal rider demand,\u201d Robert Foran, the agency\u2019s chief financial officer, said at the M.T.A. board meeting on Wednesday. \u201cThis is just ugly.

Being \u201ccalled in\u201d instead of \u201ccalled out\u201d is a much more effective way to help members of our society grow and become better people in the future. They are able to realize a mistake was made, fix that mistake, and make the proper steps in assuring this mistake will not happen again. Calling people out only crushes their confidence and esteem which leads them to hide from the public eye, unwilling to speak out on the issue and improve themselves\n\n\u2014 Bella S., Maury High School, Norfolk, VA\n\nI think in certain situations cancel culture is appropriate. For example, a celebrity who has been accused of something like pedophilia is an appropriate reason to no longer support them, or \u201ccancel\u201d them. I also think it\u2019s ok to cancel someone in your own head, if you don\u2019t like who a certain person is and what they stand for, you don\u2019t need to interact with them. However I think some people get \u201ccanceled\u201d too quickly, and people are so quick to judge they won\u2019t even try to hear that person\u2019s side of the story.\n\n\u2014 Charley Vickery, Cary High School\n\nCalling someone out is shameful compared to calling someone in. People lose their jobs over being cancelled, without a chance to ever make amends or fix their actions, forever being locked away in a pool of hate. Imagine you want to stage an intervention. You don\u2019t go \u201cYou have a problem, so I hate you, and you should be exiled.\u201d You have to help them be better, because punishment isn\u2019t good enough. If someone needs to get better, you have to shape them better.\n\n\u2014 Jayden Nguyen, Julia R. Masterman, Philadelphia\n\nCancel Culture Is Inherently Problematic.\n\nI believe that it is essential to inform someone when their behavior has been insulting or disparaging, but Cancel Culture has brought this to an unnecessary extreme. Cancel Culture originates often from good intentions, but instead of explaining how a person\u2019s behavior has been harmful to others and allowing them the opportunity to learn from their mistakes, it ostracizes a person and can leave them with doubts and poor self esteem.\n\n\u2014 Sam R, FL\n\nCancel culture often ends up being personally attacked instead of constructively criticizing the person. Most of the time when someone gets canceled, doesn\u2019t even talk to them first before canceling them. Even in one of the stories in the article about the girl being canceled. None of her friends told her about why they canceled her, they just cut her out of her life. Cancel culture can also emotionally damage someone being cancelled. They often feel helpless and become depressed \u2026 An easy solution to fix cancel culture is to personally message someone if something is bothering you about them. Instead of just cutting that person out of your life.\n\n\u2014 Aaron D., IPoly High\n\nCancel culture, in our society today, has infested every bit of our lives. People are denounced and ridiculed for their actions years ago, or things they completely regret doing. Calling people out, and publicly shaming them is not the way, but it should be used as a time for education and reflection. By showing how they\u2019re actions are wrong, they can change to be a better person. When it comes to people you personally know, cancel culture is petty and ignorant. Just because you dislike someone, doesn\u2019t mean you have to ruin their life and turn everyone against them. Give them an opportunity to reconcile, and teach them the error of their ways. As for celebrities, just because of some horrendous and heinous acts, doesn\u2019t mean we have to rip all their good contributions to society too. Just because Michael Jackson did terrible things, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not the king of pop and we can\u2019t enjoy his music. It\u2019s like saying just because the founding fathers owned slaves, we can\u2019t live and thrive in America. I think Pete Davidson said it best when he said \u201cacting like these people never existed is not the solution\u201d and later said that \u201cevery time you watch a movie or listen to a song by a serial predator, donate a dollar to a charity that helps sexual assault. I\u2019ve donated $142, and that\u2019s from the ignition remix alone.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Gavin Swartz, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL\n\nI think that cancel culture is something that is becoming too common. Of course, I know that when people do or say something wrong, we should warn them and tell them that it\u2019s wrong \u2026 Cancelling is right when we try and make people acknowledge what they\u2019ve done wrong, but everything has a limit.\n\n\u2014 Clara Almeida, Escola Americana Do Recife, Brazil"], "20201120": [], "20201121": [], "20201122": [], "20201123": ["I am white, college-educated and in my 70s. My 60-plus-year-old girlfriend is also white and college-educated. We both own our homes and alternate staying overnight at each other\u2019s house. I have some medical issues that indicate a moderately weakened immune system. She is healthy for her age. We both have been very careful about wearing masks, social distancing and so forth. She loves tennis and pickle ball and has been playing these games outside, without masks, since the spring. With the cold days upon us, she now wants to play indoors at her athletic club. While all those with whom she will play will wear masks, those on the court before her and next to her may not be wearing masks. She may play five to seven hours a week.\n\nI understand that my only role here is to tell her whether or not I will limit our time together to walking outside, not inside without a mask, no overnights, until the spring. Our doctors indicate only that there are risks involved in her potential behavior, but they will not provide any more guidance. I strongly believe that I have absolutely no right to demand any behavior of her, and she and I will respect whatever decision each of us makes. I am quite fearful, because of my somewhat fragile health, but I have not yet made a decision, nor has she. What are the ethical issues we both face? Name Withheld\n\nSo far as the ethics goes, I agree that you don\u2019t have the right to demand that your girlfriend not engage in these activities, though you do have the right to insist on social distancing if she does. But as someone who loves her, you should make sure that she\u2019s aware of the risks she\u2019s exposing herself to. Each of you has primary responsibility for your own health, but part of loving people is ensuring they are acting on reliable information about the risks they face and the risks they might pose to others.\n\nInevitably, then, the issues you must grapple with are as much about what the risks are in your situation as they are about how you ought, ethically, to deal with them. The risks, first, depend on how dangerous an infection might be. We\u2019re learning new things about the virus every day; estimates of the dangers here are a moving target. But according to one (un-peer-reviewed) paper I\u2019ve seen, between the ages of 65 and 75, the infection fatality rate \u2014 the chance of dying if you get the disease \u2014 rises from about 1 in 70 to about 1 in 22. (At 85, it\u2019s close to 1 in 7.)

In the Qumul region of eastern Xinjiang, for example, Dawut recorded an epic recounting a 17th-century insurrection against the Zunghar Mongols following their bloody conquest of Qumul. \u201cListen as I share the past,\u201d sang a well-known Qumul folk poet before narrating the tragic story of Yachibeg, who led the rebellion to a string of victories before a local official betrayed him.\n\nDawut celebrated the richness and vitality of Uighur culture while remaining keenly aware of the pressures it continued to face. \u201cEvery time I went off on fieldwork,\u201d she noted in a 2010 essay, \u201cI would return from the \u2018living museum\u2019 of the people determined to gather even more material. Sadly, by the time I went back, these materials would be gone,\u201d as local officials obstructed the performance and transmission of oral poetry. Dawut herself is now gone, detained since late 2017 along with many of Xinjiang University\u2019s other Uighur professors.\n\nToday, as the Chinese state bans Uighur books and paves over Muslim graveyards, poetry remains a powerful form of persistence and resistance for the Uighur people. Uighurs around the world are turning to poetry to grapple with the calamity in their homeland. \u201cThe target on my forehead / could not bring me to my knees,\u201d wrote the exile poet Tahir Hamut Izgil from Washington in 2018.\n\nEven as intellectuals in the Uighur diaspora chronicle the atrocities, most prominent Uighur intellectuals in Xinjiang \u2014 liberals and conservatives, devout Muslims and agnostics, party supporters and party critics \u2014 have already vanished into the camps as China escalates its campaign to extinguish Uighur identity.\n\nBut identity is a stubborn thing, as the Uighur poet and novelist Perhat Tursun asserted in a well-known poem beginning with these defiant lines:\n\nLike the waters of the Tarim\n\nwe began in this place\n\nand we will finish here\n\nWe came from nowhere else\n\nand we will not leave for anywhere\n\nIf God made humanity\n\nGod made us for this place\n\nIf man evolved from apes\n\nwe evolved from the apes of this place\n\nFor months after Tursun first posted this poem online over a decade ago, friends of mine in Urumqi would quote snatches of it by heart. In early 2018, as China\u2019s purge of Uighur intellectuals widened, Tursun was sent to the camps. Yet his voice still reverberates: As I was writing this, I saw that a diaspora Uighur activist had posted Tursun\u2019s poem to social media, where it continues to circulate widely.\n\nThe world has much to learn from a culture that has made art its antidote to authoritarianism.

For those expecting or at least hoping to see broad consensus, the results were a gut punch. It's difficult to imagine that a significant number of Americans see the world through different eyes and, in many cases, are constructing an alternate reality. It\u2019s confounding to pundits, pollsters and our neighbors alike.\n\nBut seen through the lens of our online lives, such an outcome makes perfect sense. While it is uniquely difficult to map or quantify, what is impossible to ignore is that how we behave on platforms like Facebook shapes and reflects a core expression of our identities.\n\nBen Collins, an NBC News reporter who covers disinformation and online extremism, argued recently that one takeaway from our recent election ought to be that it\u2019s \u201cwell past the time to start realizing that what people say on Facebook and in comments sections is what they actually mean.\u201d The fights, the jokes and the memes are all an expression of legitimate feelings \u2014 all the more authentic because, unlike getting a call from a pollster or talking to a reporter, we often feel as though nobody\u2019s watching.\n\nDespite spending years studying these toxic dynamics and the better part of a month watching them up close in strangers\u2019 feeds, I was still, like so many, surprised to see it all reflected at the ballot box.

Bush were among the first politicians to recognize the power of Latino conservatives. While in office, Trump also came around to the idea that they represented a valuable bloc. In 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, Trump made his first presidential appearance before a Hispanic organization. The event was a luncheon hosted by the Latino Coalition. Standing before some 300 coalition members, Trump emphasized their common policy goals: deregulation, tax cuts, infrastructure projects. \u201cLatino-owned businesses now make up more than 10 percent of all businesses in the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cproviding jobs for more than two million American workers.

Hispanics that voted for Donald Trump did not vote for Donald Trump because of the comments that he made during the campaign. They didn\u2019t vote for him because they thought that he was going to be against their best interests. They didn\u2019t vote for him because they thought he was insensitive to racial issues. They voted for him because of his message of improving the economy.\u201d\n\nGarza describes himself as a \u201cconservatarian\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m conservative in some things and libertarian in other things.\u201d He opposes legal abortion but not laws allowing same-sex marriage. He worries about the problems hamstringing America\u2019s Latino population \u2014 poverty, high-school-dropout rates, children born out of wedlock \u2014 but wants solutions to come from churches, individuals and private charities, not government. (Exceptions should be made, he said, for \u201cfolks who are truly dependent\u201d: children, some people with disabilities, some elderly people and some veterans.) His favorite political philosopher is Friedrich A. von Hayek, the Austrian who argued that economic markets should be virtually unregulated. From Hayek, Garza absorbed the notion that democratic socialism will eventually lead to Soviet-style communism. \u201cI have to accept inequality in order to preserve freedom, because inequality is going to happen when people\u2019s talents are so varied and so different,\u201d Garza told me one day as we sat inside his home in Mission. \u201cFor some reason, people who believe in fairness, they\u2019re OK with government coercion and subscribing everybody to one category. I can\u2019t buy into that.\u201d\n\nGarza\u2019s parents were migrant farmworkers. They harvested grapes in California, hoed sugar beets in Nebraska and picked cherries, peaches, pears and apples in Washington State. Garza himself dropped out of high school and got his equivalency diploma when he was 17. He pruned and picked until he was 19. But the way Garza tells it, the defining moments of his childhood were not the hours he spent in the orchards but the ones he spent in church. He was 6 when faith transformed his family. After his father joined an evangelical church, he stopped smoking, drinking, gambling and having extramarital affairs. The family bought a small home, which they later improved and sold for a profit. Eventually, they bought a motel with 16 units, then sold it and opened a Mexican restaurant.

Every event I observed in Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Texas leaned evangelical in both students and staff. Libre\u2019s emphasis on self-reliance plays well with this audience, and several of its leaders shared stories with me about how their own families worked their way out of poverty. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to eat government cheese,\u201d says David P.

Libre has the money to provide the services his congregation needs. Barrero told me that Libre\u2019s funds came from a \u201cvery generous person or group of people with millions of dollars to help people who are struggling.\u201d When I mentioned that generous person\u2019s name was Charles Koch, Barrero was indifferent.\n\nGarza had predicted that worries about the Koch network \u2014 which spent several hundred million dollars on down-ballot races in 2016, as Jane Mayer reported in \u201cDark Money,\u201d and had \u201ca bigger payroll than the Republican National Committee\u201d \u2014 would not tarnish Libre\u2019s reputation with conservative Latinos. \u201cRegular folk who are not paid to be activists, they don\u2019t care about that,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you on my side or not?

Governments, banks, credit card companies and online communities are among the factions trying to change how people make payments, he said.", "Mr. George recalled a similar surge a decade ago, when the global economy cratered. \u201cIt also bred a lot of fear and uncertainty in people,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s just the innate human reflex, that need to have more control over what you\u2019re eating, what you\u2019re growing, because who knows what tomorrow holds.\u201d\n\nVendors have also noted a shift in their target audience. \u201cOur core demographic in the past was retirees and semi-retirees,\u201d Mr. Tingley said. \u201cBut with Covid, our demographic is getting younger and younger, with more people with young kids who want to teach them about gardening, or want to feed their kids fresh veggies.\u201d\n\nFor Mark Wells, 52, and his wife, Magdalena Wells, 46, of West Milton, Ohio, building a greenhouse was a way to secure those fresh veggies. Like many Americans, they were alarmed in the spring when they saw the shelves at their grocery store picked clean \u2014 when they even wanted to go in the grocery store.\n\n\u201cAt the time, if you were looking at produce, how many people touched it?\u201d Mr. Wells said. \u201cDid you want people touching all your produce and squeezing your melons and putting them back? We\u2019re not germaphobes by any means. But you didn\u2019t know anything back then.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to grow their own. The couple had the benefit of time: Before the pandemic, Mrs. Wells ran a cleaning service in Cleveland and Mr. Wells was working as a general contractor, two industries curtailed for months. The greenhouse gave Mr. Wells the chance to hire some of his staff to help him. \u201cI didn\u2019t lay people off,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to keep everybody busy.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Wells was largely in charge of construction, which took about a month and a half, Mrs. Wells now runs it. Before he had finished installing the automatic vented windows and a fan, she planted several tomatoes that ended up dying in the heat. Since that first \u201coverzealous\u201d mistake, she has grown a new round of tomatoes, as well cucumbers, eggplants and onions, thanks to a curtain she installed on one side to further reduce heat. Now, with the change of season, she has started focusing on raising herbs like basil and dill.", "I am white, college-educated and in my 70s. My 60-plus-year-old girlfriend is also white and college-educated. We both own our homes and alternate staying overnight at each other\u2019s house. I have some medical issues that indicate a moderately weakened immune system. She is healthy for her age. We both have been very careful about wearing masks, social distancing and so forth. She loves tennis and pickle ball and has been playing these games outside, without masks, since the spring. With the cold days upon us, she now wants to play indoors at her athletic club. While all those with whom she will play will wear masks, those on the court before her and next to her may not be wearing masks. She may play five to seven hours a week.\n\nI understand that my only role here is to tell her whether or not I will limit our time together to walking outside, not inside without a mask, no overnights, until the spring. Our doctors indicate only that there are risks involved in her potential behavior, but they will not provide any more guidance. I strongly believe that I have absolutely no right to demand any behavior of her, and she and I will respect whatever decision each of us makes. I am quite fearful, because of my somewhat fragile health, but I have not yet made a decision, nor has she. What are the ethical issues we both face? Name Withheld\n\nSo far as the ethics goes, I agree that you don\u2019t have the right to demand that your girlfriend not engage in these activities, though you do have the right to insist on social distancing if she does. But as someone who loves her, you should make sure that she\u2019s aware of the risks she\u2019s exposing herself to. Each of you has primary responsibility for your own health, but part of loving people is ensuring they are acting on reliable information about the risks they face and the risks they might pose to others.\n\nInevitably, then, the issues you must grapple with are as much about what the risks are in your situation as they are about how you ought, ethically, to deal with them. The risks, first, depend on how dangerous an infection might be. We\u2019re learning new things about the virus every day; estimates of the dangers here are a moving target. But according to one (un-peer-reviewed) paper I\u2019ve seen, between the ages of 65 and 75, the infection fatality rate \u2014 the chance of dying if you get the disease \u2014 rises from about 1 in 70 to about 1 in 22. (At 85, it\u2019s close to 1 in 7.) And death isn\u2019t the only thing to worry about; it\u2019s possible to suffer long-term consequences even if you survive infection.", "One of her early teaching gigs took place in the lobby of the little theater in Austin where she was a company member. She would arrive early, let herself in, sweep up, unload a tub of mats from her car and grid them across the floor. Pupils paid for the class in donations; one woman paid in vegetables. Right when things were starting to take off \u2014 when people were driving in from San Antonio and asking for photos after class \u2014 the theater company lost its lease, Mishler\u2019s teaching space evaporated and she was forced into virtual entrepreneurship. The first \u201cYoga With Adriene\u201d video is still up on Mishler\u2019s channel, and it features both a \u201cWest Side Story\u201d reference and the first of many invitations for viewers to \u201cfind what feels good.\u201d By late 2014, the channel had surpassed 150,000 subscribers. In 2017, it was at 2.4 million. Four million the year after that. (This notoriety hasn\u2019t translated into status in the yoga establishment; she has never been featured, for example, in the pages of Yoga Journal.)\n\nIn some ways, Mishler\u2019s practice aligns with the greater trends of Western yoga. It is athleticized and somewhat despiritualized; it magically reconciles the paradoxical yearnings for decadence and asceticism. Taking time for yourself, honoring your body, luxuriating in a moment free of responsibilities: decadence. Focusing the mind, toning up, sweating out the \u201ctoxins\u201d: ascetic. But her deviations from the norm are significant, and they start with her presence. Though Mishler describes herself as \u201cwhite-passing,\u201d her mother is Mexican and was the first of 12 siblings to attend college. And her business is \u2014 to put it in the terms of the industry \u2014 not optimized for monetization.\n\nMishler\u2019s director of operations told me that they turn down $250,000 to $500,000 a year in ads. Mishler does earn a comfortable living from YouTube ads, but unlike many influencers, she refuses to run them in the middle of her videos, which might leave you learning about competitive rates on car insurance while stuck in extended puppy pose. She has supplementary courses for sale and the online T-shirt shop, but there\u2019s also enough free yoga on the channel to keep most people going for a lifetime. It\u2019s the internet equivalent of a roadside farm stand with an honor-system box, albeit a pretty lucrative one.\n\nIn spirit, Mishler\u2019s version of the internet harks back to the days of primitive message boards and GeoCities, when everyone was still innocently dazzled by the ability to connect with random people over shared interests and nobody was disseminating revenge porn or buying Uzis on the dark web. The \u201cYoga With Adriene\u201d community receives her services with a kind of expansive gratitude and positivity that is freakish in the context of social media. Scrolling through the comments under a video of a gorgeous woman in tight clothing is usually a recipe for suicidal ideation, but there\u2019s an eerie lack of trolling in Mishler\u2019s realm. A part of this, she said, was because YouTube allows creators to filter out certain words \u2014 profanity and anatomical language, for example. But most of it is organic, and even the oddballs play nice. \u201cThe foot-fetish community,\u201d Mishler said, by way of example, \u201cis very respectful, very polite.\u201d", "Even if both manage to stay away from Facebook for good, their stories are just two in a sea of billions. No story is the same because no feed is the same. And yet these same dynamics that tortured my two participants \u2014 a sea of contextless news and acrimonious comments revealing their neighbors\u2019 worst selves \u2014 are on display for millions of Americans every day.\n\nThat thought bounced around my head this month as the election returns trickled in, revealing in unmistakable detail the footprint of a divided nation. For those expecting or at least hoping to see broad consensus, the results were a gut punch. It's difficult to imagine that a significant number of Americans see the world through different eyes and, in many cases, are constructing an alternate reality. It\u2019s confounding to pundits, pollsters and our neighbors alike.\n\nBut seen through the lens of our online lives, such an outcome makes perfect sense. While it is uniquely difficult to map or quantify, what is impossible to ignore is that how we behave on platforms like Facebook shapes and reflects a core expression of our identities.\n\nBen Collins, an NBC News reporter who covers disinformation and online extremism, argued recently that one takeaway from our recent election ought to be that it\u2019s \u201cwell past the time to start realizing that what people say on Facebook and in comments sections is what they actually mean.\u201d The fights, the jokes and the memes are all an expression of legitimate feelings \u2014 all the more authentic because, unlike getting a call from a pollster or talking to a reporter, we often feel as though nobody\u2019s watching.\n\nDespite spending years studying these toxic dynamics and the better part of a month watching them up close in strangers\u2019 feeds, I was still, like so many, surprised to see it all reflected at the ballot box. We shouldn\u2019t have been surprised; our divisions have been in front of our faces and inside our feeds this whole time.", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cThe Losses We Share,\u201d by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex (Op-Ed, Nov. 25), about her experience of a miscarriage:\n\nDecades ago, I also suffered a miscarriage.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s top lieutenants said they were willing to negotiate \u2014 but not until the farmers moved to New Delhi\u2019s outskirts and stopped blocking highways.

You could chalk up some of the musings to the pandemic, but Ms. Keys, 39, has also been masterminding a beauty-meets-self-care line called Keys Soulcare, which will debut on Dec. 3.\n\nThe line, which includes skin care and home scents, is inspired by beauty rituals that make her feel good \u2014 aptly timed for these stressful days. See what she likes below.\n\nDay and Night\n\nI love both routines \u2014 day and night. Both are really special and important in their own ways. If it\u2019s morning, my routine depends on the day. Sometimes I\u2019m super rush-y. More mornings are like the rush-y ones, but sometimes I have time to luxuriate. I definitely have oily skin, and I\u2019ve been prone to breakouts.\n\nAt the beginning of my career, I didn\u2019t know what was going on. I was under the camera and under hot lights, and that definitely did not help. I didn\u2019t have any skin experience. My mother wasn\u2019t a big beauty type of girl. She\u2019d just say, \u201cHere\u2019s a wash, here\u2019s a lotion, now go about your day.\u201d I had to try a lot of different things, from makeup artists and other experts I\u2019ve met, and it wasn\u2019t until my mid-20s that I figured out, \u201cOh, this is how people do this.\u201d", "Hollywood was another, altogether tougher industry, where women had long been at the mercy of powerful male studio heads and directors, and where even Streisand, already a major star, struggled to make herself heard. \u201cDon\u2019t let them do to you what they did to me,\u201d Garland famously advised Streisand in the 1960s. Women were typically paid less than their male co-stars and strictly relegated to acting. \u201cActresses did not direct,\u201d Streisand recalls. But for \u201cFunny Girl,\u201d her first film, she watched the dailies with its Oscar-winning director, William Wyler, offering her opinions along the way and learning the craft from one of its masters.\n\nLater, for \u201cThe Way We Were,\u201d Streisand\u2019s co-star, Robert Redford, got $750,000 plus a share of the profits, while Streisand also got profit-sharing but was paid $400,000 less. She wanted to star in and direct a sequel, but requested a $400,000 director\u2019s fee to make up the pay difference. Her producer, Ray Stark, flatly refused. No sequel was made. In those years, male stars negotiated for a percentage of a film\u2019s gross revenue, rather than the often nonexistent net profit. Streisand joined their ranks with 1976\u2019s \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d and helped begin the still-ongoing fight for gender pay equity in Hollywood. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d recalls Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent who represented her during the \u201980s and \u201990s. \u201cThe business didn\u2019t value women as much as men. Barbra could be tough as nails. She stood up for what she believed in, with enormous integrity.\u201d\n\nStreisand in political fund-raising mode \u2018is dazzling to behold,\u2019 says Nancy Pelosi. \u2018It\u2019s not just because she\u2019s a celebrity. She knows the issues. She\u2019s studied. She can explain why she supports what she does. That\u2019s what\u2019s persuasive.\u2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1983, with \u201cYentl,\u201d that she finally got the chance to direct. She\u2019d bought the rights to the Isaac Bashevis Singer short story \u201cYentl the Yeshiva Boy\u201d in 1970. Her original vision was for a nonmusical, black-and-white art film, but \u201cthe only way I could get \u2018Yentl\u2019 made was to sing in it,\u201d she says. The movie eventually emerged as a lavish full-color musical. Streisand starred as a young woman in a Jewish shtetl who poses as a man to pursue an education. She also directed, co-wrote the screenplay and produced it.\n\n\u201cYentl\u201d grossed over $40 million and won Streisand a Golden Globe for best director, but not even a nomination from the male-dominated Directors Guild of America. \u201cMaybe in the next few years, with more women directing, they\u2019ll get used to us,\u201d Streisand said at that year\u2019s Globes ceremony. Since then, only one woman has won the Oscar for best director \u2014 Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 (and only five women have been nominated). \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace more women haven\u2019t,\u201d Streisand says. She hasn\u2019t directed a film since 1996\u2019s \u201cThe Mirror Has Two Faces,\u201d a romantic comedy in which Streisand \u2014 finally \u2014 wins and keeps her handsome leading man, played by Jeff Bridges. It proved to be a case of life imitating art: The year the movie was released, Streisand met Brolin.\n\nSTREISAND\u2019S INSISTENCE on control and obsession with detail have been criticized for much of her life: She is \u201cdifficult,\u201d \u201cdemanding,\u201d a \u201cperfectionist,\u201d all of which she readily acknowledges. It\u2019s hard to imagine a comparable male star or director being subjected to the same criticism. In any event, it\u2019s impossible to fault the results. \u201cSo she\u2019s a perfectionist,\u201d says Kosarin. \u201cMost geniuses are perfectionists. Look at Steve Jobs.\u201d\n\nWhile Streisand insists that money is secondary to her, financial security is another form of control. She\u2019s brought the same determination and self-education to stocks as to art, antiques and real estate. Jim Cramer, who discussed the market with her as a hedge fund manager before he became a popular CNBC host, told me she knew more about initial public offerings than most traders. \u201cAnd she hated to lose,\u201d he adds.\n\nStreisand says she\u2019s earned millions trading stocks \u2014 several million between 1998 and 2000 alone. (\u201cI\u2019d be up at 6:30, light a fire, have a hot chocolate and trade until 1 p.m.\u201d) She admits she\u2019s not the most disciplined investor: She panicked during the crash in 1987 (\u201cI lost a fortune\u201d), and again in March when the market plunged because of pandemic fears. But her instincts have been sound: She bought Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google shares when her then-financial adviser said they were too speculative. Her adviser steered her into Disney stock in 2011, and she likes to give shares as presents to children in her life. She can get the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, on the phone and recently asked him to correct Siri\u2019s pronunciation of her name from Strei-zand to Strei-sand. He agreed. \u201cPeople mispronounce my name no matter how famous I am,\u201d she laments."]}
