Kinsa also cited Missouri and Utah as states where daily case counts will climb, though absolute case numbers may not look out of control. And the company pointed to the Midwest as an area to watch closely. It said it was seeing \u201cboth increasing atypical Rt and increasing fever counts\u201d in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan, suggesting a forthcoming rise in confirmed cases. Pennsylvania, too, \u201cmight see an uptick.\u201d\n\nThere are limitations to the data. I showed the Kinsa transmission charts to an epidemiologist, who noted that the data didn\u2019t do much to detect the duration of the outbreaks, meaning the data isn\u2019t a perfect stand-in for how much disease is out there and how long it stays. But Kinsa told me it\u2019s not really tracking outbreaks; it\u2019s tracking atypical illnesses and whether transmission is higher or lower than expected. So perhaps the best way to think about Kinsa\u2019s data is as a way to identify anomalies in data, which public health officials can then explore in their communities. It\u2019s a warning siren, not a detailed accounting of what has happened.\n\nFor Andy Slavitt, the former acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration and an adviser to the government on the coronavirus pandemic, information from Kinsa was an imperfect but helpful early piece of evidence to persuade the public and elected leaders to help flatten the curve.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with the beginning of a novel pandemic, you have no data \u2014 you\u2019re the guy in the desert trying to find a tiny sip of water and there it is,\u201d Mr. Slavitt told me. \u201cKinsa was one of the first to have something that remotely approached a leading indicator. Does it have limitations? Yes. But it\u2019s something.\u201d\n\nAmong those limitations is the varying nature of Covid-19 cases by community. I put the question of using Kinsa thermometers for outbreak surveillance to Cindy Farr, the incident commander for the Missoula City-County Health Department\u2019s Covid-19 response where I live in Montana. Missoula is a midsize city that locked down early and has avoided an uncontrolled outbreak. As a result, it has opened up sizable portions of its economy \u2014 in my figuring, a perfect candidate for an advance-warning system.\n\nBut Ms. Farr wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cBecause our outbreak has been so mild and our population density is low, only about one-third of our cases have reported fevers,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it likely wouldn\u2019t be a reliable indicator for the area.\u201d But other, larger cites have shown interest. Philadelphia is distributing thermometers and using Kinsa data as a way to know when to reinstitute social distancing should cases surge.", "In Florida, where daily case counts soared to new records over the weekend, the city of Jacksonville said Monday that face masks would be required in any indoor public place where social distancing was not possible. The city is scheduled to host the Republican National Convention in August.\n\nSeveral other cities and counties across the state are also moving to reimpose restrictions in response to the surge, which has followed the reopening of beaches, bars, restaurants and other social activities. South Florida counties closed their beaches for the Fourth of July holiday weekend.\n\nGov. Bill Lee of Tennessee signed an executive order on Monday extending his state\u2019s emergency order and some other pandemic measures until Aug. 29.

A few weeks ago, she decided it was time.\n\nThe hospital lab she went to, operated by Edward-Elmhurst Health, told Hayum-Gross to wear a mask and gave her a number to call when she arrived in the parking lot. Outside the front door, she was met by a staffer who took her temperature, asked several screening questions and gave her hand sanitizer.\n\n\u201cOnce I passed that, a phlebotomist met me on the other side of the door and took me to a chair that was still wet with disinfectant. She wore a mask and gloves, and there was no one else around,\u201d Hayum-Gross said. \u201cWhen I saw the precautions they had put in place and the almost military precision with which they were carrying them out, I felt much better.\u201d\n\nMarjorie Helsel DeWert, 67, of Athens, Ohio, was similarly impressed when she visited her dentist recently and noticed circular yellow signs on the floor of the office, spaced six feet apart, indicating where people should stand.

As the coronavirus took hold of Europe in March and Britain went into lockdown, the school closed. Lessons went online, and the final show was canceled in favor of a June 17 digital presentation in which each student could show only two looks and a 90-second video.

Rather than aiming for anything awkwardly edgy or wildly off-model, Shukert and Aniello have instead delivered a kid-friendly show that\u2019s true to the novels, telling episodic stories about a group of teenage girls who overcome their differences to run a small business together.\n\n\u2018Mucho Mucho Amor\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: July 8\n\nThe flamboyant Puerto Rican astrologer Walter Mercado died in 2019, after fading from public life a few years earlier.

The filmmakers may not quite get all the way to the bottom of Mercado\u2019s image-conscious, larger-than-life personality \u2014 he does manage to retain some mystery. But \u201cMucho Mucho Amor\u201d is still impressively comprehensive, covering not just the biography of a beloved cultural icon but also weighing what his presence meant to the L.G.B.T.Q. community \u2014 and to anyone else who has ever yearned to live an unusual life.\n\n\u2018Cursed\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: July 17\n\nBased on a young adult novel by Tom Wheeler (with illustrations by the comic book artist Frank Miller), \u201cCursed\u201d retells some of the Arthurian legends from the perspective of the young enchantress later known as \u201cthe Lady of the Lake.\u201d Katherine Langford plays the lady, Nimue, who suffers setbacks and tragedy as she discovers her mystical calling. Wheeler \u2014 a veteran TV writer who serves as the series\u2019s co-executive producer with Miller \u2014 adopts the familiar pulp fantasy style of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cThe Witcher\u201d but with a somewhat lighter touch.

Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming shared a photograph on Twitter of her father, the former vice president, wearing a cowboy hat and pale blue surgical mask, adding the hashtag \u201c#realmenwearmasks.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have shunned masks because Mr. Trump has declined to wear them and stressed that doing so was voluntary. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it,\u201d he said in April. On Tuesday, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Senate Health Committee, appealed to the president to wear one.\n\nThe new entreaties follow months of misinformation, debate and confusion about the question of wearing a mask. Early in the pandemic, government officials instructed Americans not to buy or wear masks. In April, they revised that guidance, advising that cloth face coverings were recommended.\n\nMost of the public does not appear to have an aversion to masks. In a New York Times/Siena College poll published last week, 54 percent of people said they always wear a mask when they expect to be in proximity to other people, while another 22 percent said they usually wear a mask. Masks will soon be mandated in at least 19 states.\n\nMr. Trump spoke less skeptically about masks on Wednesday than he has in the past. Asked whether Americans should be required to wear them, he said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if you need mandatory because you have many places in the country where people stay very long distance. You talk about social distancing. But I\u2019m all for masks. I think masks are good. I would wear one if I were in a group of people and I was close.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said that he had worn a mask before, but that it was usually not necessary, because he and anyone allowed near him were regularly tested. \u201cBut if I were in a tight situation with people, I would, absolutely,\u201d he said."]}
