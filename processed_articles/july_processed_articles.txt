And, of course, I was named for her. When I was in my early 40s, a young historian who was working on a Ph.D. dissertation about Black women in the suffrage movement was the first one to show me Adella\u2019s writings. I hadn\u2019t had that kind of specifics before, and I got totally hooked on trying to find out more about her as a suffragist. My father was dead by that time, so I asked my mother, \u201cDid you know all this?\u201d And her response was, \u201cOf course.\u201d Not only was Adella involved, but my mother\u2019s mother was, too: They were both light-skinned enough to pass, so the two grandmothers, well before my parents were born, would go together to white suffrage conferences in the South, and then come back and share the information they learned with the Black community.\n\nBut even before I knew the details of my family\u2019s story, voting and political involvement were very much a part of my growing up. One of my first memories is of my hand reaching up for my mother\u2019s as she walked with me to the New York Public Library, down through this back labyrinth to where the voting booths were. I always knew that this was something very precious, and not to be taken for granted.", "\u201cI have a lot of things that could spark, but won\u2019t,\u201d he told me one of the first times we spoke. He spent nearly a decade seeking financing for a script he wrote called \u201cFrank or Francis,\u201d a musical about an internet troll\u2019s deranged feud with a film director that included 50 original songs. The only way a studio would let Kaufman direct it, he was told, was if he loaded it with movie stars. So he got Steve Carell and Jack Black attached. Also Cate Blanchett, Nicolas Cage, Emma Thompson, Kevin Kline, Elizabeth Banks and Catherine Keener. But still, it wasn\u2019t enough. He developed ideas for television, then watched them founder. He took jobs to pay his mortgage, including an uncredited rewrite on \u201cKung Fu Panda 2.\u201d In 2015, he co-directed the critically exalted, stop-animation film \u201cAnomalisa,\u201d with Duke Johnson, based on a script Kaufman wrote for a live radio play \u2014 but only after Johnson\u2019s company raised the initial chunk of the project\u2019s budget on Kickstarter. And in all that time, Kaufman made a point of being disarmingly transparent with the press about the obstacles he met with, which the press at times overemphasized, much to his embarrassment. (New York Magazine, 2016: \u201cCharlie Kaufman Is Having a Pretty Depressing Existential Crisis: \u2018I Wonder If It\u2019s Not Cool or Sexy to Be in Business With Me.\u2019\u201d)\n\nWhen a book editor first approached Kaufman, in 2011, asking if he\u2019d ever thought about writing a novel, he recognized how liberating that might be. Whatever he chose to write wouldn\u2019t have to be filmed or budgeted, or screened for a test audience, or tweaked to get a particular rating. If he wanted to write about an army of animatronic Donald Trumps, known as \u201cTrunks,\u201d or place a new mountain range in the middle of North America, he could. And if he wanted his protagonist to have sexual intercourse with that mountain range, he could do that, too. And more than that: He had to do it. Though he hadn\u2019t seriously written prose in 40 years, and kept imagining critics punishing him for his ineptitude, or just his audacity for trying something new, he took the same approach that he does with his screenplays. Ideas that came up that felt like \u201cOh, you absolutely can\u2019t do that\u201d \u2014 those were the ideas that Kaufman forced himself toward. \u201cI have to put myself in a position to fail ridiculously,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was never clearer to me than when he talked about writing \u201cAdaptation.\u201d In short: Kaufman signed on to adapt \u201cThe Orchid Thief,\u201d by Susan Orlean \u2014 a delicate, wide-ranging, meditative book about orchids, loosely centered on the story of an oddball Floridian plant poacher but without any hint of conventional plot \u2014 precisely because he had no idea how it could be done. After spending months in an \u201coverwhelming depression\u201d over the project, as he put it, he finally stepped back from the source material to consider what was preoccupying him at that moment in his own life, hoping to find something that felt alive, or sufficiently kinetic, to push him forward. And what was preoccupying him was obvious: \u201cThis idea occurred to me,\u201d he says, \u201cand it opened things up.\u201d\n\nIn the end, \u201cAdaptation\u201d centered on the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, struggling to adapt \u201cThe Orchid Thief.\u201d In one of the first scenes, we see Nicolas Cage, as Kaufman, flop-sweating at lunch with a befuddled Hollywood executive, waving a copy of Orlean\u2019s book in the air and ranting about how he doesn\u2019t want to \u201ccram in sex or guns or car chases, or characters learning profound life lessons ... or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. The book isn\u2019t like that,\u201d he insists, and \u201clife isn\u2019t like that. It just isn\u2019t.\u201d It was precisely what the real Kaufman explained to a real Hollywood executive before taking the job.\n\nDiscussing Kaufman\u2019s creative process in my first draft, I described him as essentially constructing tortuous escape rooms for himself, then writing his way out. This approach seemed to cause him so much suffering that I eventually asked him:\n\n\u201cIs there any part of you that feels afflicted by your convictions?\u201d Did he ever just wish he could write an action film or something? \u201cThere\u2019s no part of you that wishes it were easier?\u201d \u201cI would like to have money that I don\u2019t have,\u201d he replied, \u201cand I tell myself that I could write a commercial blockbuster.\u201d But he also understood that he might be flattering himself; he\u2019d never actually tried. He was proud of his commitment to do original, meaningful work. \u201cThere\u2019s lots and lots of garbage out there that isn\u2019t honest and isn\u2019t trying to help clarify or explore the human condition in any way,\u201d he told me, \u201cand it sends people down the wrong road\u201d \u2014 skews our perceptions of our own lives, and each other \u2014 \u201cand it\u2019s mind-numbing and it\u2019s toxic, and I don\u2019t want to have that on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I don\u2019t even mean my professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a human being.\u201d\n\nSpike Jonze, who directed both \u201cAdaptation\u201d and \u201cBeing John Malkovich,\u201d compared Kaufman to Kanye West \u2014 albeit haltingly and with a number of disclaimers. \u201cThis is a weird comparison,\u201d Jonze told me, \u201cand I hesitate to bring him up because everyone has an opinion about this person, but. ...\u201d Jonze and West have been friends and collaborators for 15 years, he said, almost as long as Jonze has been a friend and collaborator of Kaufman\u2019s. \u201cAnd the thing about Kanye is,\u201d Jonze said, \u201cit\u2019s not that Kanye doesn\u2019t care what people think about him. It hurts his feelings if he\u2019s misunderstood, like anybody. But he can\u2019t not be himself. He has no choice in the matter. And I think Charlie\u2019s the same way.\u201d\n\nJonze stuttered a bit, then added: \u201cAgain, I hesitate to make the comparison. They\u2019re so different in every other way.\u201d Then he was quiet for a moment, a long moment, searching for another way to capture it.", "Some conservatives and libertarians have made opposition to masks a political cause, but, as cases surge, a growing number of Republican governors are trying to send a different message.\n\nVice President Mike Pence has abruptly started wearing and recommending masks. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming shared a photograph on Twitter of her father, the former vice president, wearing a cowboy hat and pale blue surgical mask, adding the hashtag \u201c#realmenwearmasks.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have shunned masks because Mr. Trump has declined to wear them and stressed that doing so was voluntary. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it,\u201d he said in April. On Tuesday, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Senate Health Committee, appealed to the president to wear one.\n\nThe new entreaties follow months of misinformation, debate and confusion about the question of wearing a mask. Early in the pandemic, government officials instructed Americans not to buy or wear masks. In April, they revised that guidance, advising that cloth face coverings were recommended.\n\nMost of the public does not appear to have an aversion to masks. In a New York Times/Siena College poll published last week, 54 percent of people said they always wear a mask when they expect to be in proximity to other people, while another 22 percent said they usually wear a mask. Masks will soon be mandated in at least 19 states.\n\nMr. Trump spoke less skeptically about masks on Wednesday than he has in the past. Asked whether Americans should be required to wear them, he said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if you need mandatory because you have many places in the country where people stay very long distance. You talk about social distancing. But I\u2019m all for masks. I think masks are good. I would wear one if I were in a group of people and I was close.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said that he had worn a mask before, but that it was usually not necessary, because he and anyone allowed near him were regularly tested. \u201cBut if I were in a tight situation with people, I would, absolutely,\u201d he said."], "20200702": [], "20200703": [], "20200704": [], "20200705": [], "20200706": [], "20200707": ["A confirmed diagnosis may take time.\n\nDiagnosis represents the first step on this rare disease journey. Sometimes doctors will notice something off about the child during a newborn screening, and a genetic test will identify a known mutation in the DNA. But not all conditions are so quickly detected, and it can take several years for parents to get a confirmed diagnosis.\n\nAbout half of all children never get that far, according to Marshall Summar, M.D., the director of the Rare Disease Institute at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. \u201cWhen you sequence someone\u2019s DNA, you are going to find a lot of changes,\u201d Dr. Summar said. \u201cFiguring out which change might be the one that is causing it is a tremendous challenge.\u201d\n\nGenetic counselors warn parents beforehand that they may not get a definitive answer as to what condition their child could have. They may have to check back each year. Dr. Summar estimates that between five and 10 new rare diseases are described in the scientific literature every week, making it challenging for the medical field to keep up.\n\nMeanwhile, the realization that a child may have a debilitating, lifelong condition weighs heavily. \u201cSome parents, particularly mothers, blame themselves,\u201d said Lemuel Pelentsov, Ph.D., a nurse who studies the needs of rare disease families at the University of South Australia, in Adelaide. In a 2016 study by Dr. Pelentsov and his colleagues, about 40 percent of the 300 rare parents surveyed reported being treated for depression and an equal number for anxiety. \u201cOne of the things they do to combat that,\u201d he said, \u201cis get very invested in the child\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\nFamilies will find support in each other.\n\nWhen parents reach out to other parents, they are not simply looking for emotional support or advice. They are rebuilding a social life, one that will revolve around their child\u2019s disease. Many rare diseases have their own support groups. Global Genes is an umbrella group that supports 600 disease-specific foundations, as well as parents of children whose diseases are so rare they have no foundation.\n\n\u201cWe encourage folks to work together,\u201d said Kimberly Haugstad, the organization\u2019s executive director whose son has a rare form of hemophilia, a condition in which the blood doesn\u2019t clot normally. \u201cThe parent is going to come from such different places in their own walk of life.\u201d\n\nSome parents will start nonprofits or fund research.\n\nEach year, Global Genes hosts a \u201cRare Boot Camp\u201d to mentor and teach parents how to set up a nonprofit, create patient registries and fund research. After attending the boot camp, the Van Wyks and other parents founded GACI Global, an organization that connects families affected by GACI, along with medical professionals.", "As the British authorities ease confinement restrictions but continue to fear new waves of infections, they have announced that nursing home residents will be tested for the virus monthly, with staff members tested weekly.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s government also pledged 600 million pounds, or $749 million, in support of the country\u2019s nursing homes in May, in addition to \u00a33.2 billion \u2014 $4 billion \u2014 to local governments for key public services like nursing-home facilities.\n\nCity halls in the U.S. find ways to reopen.\n\nAfter months of waiting for a steep drop in cases that never came, many local governments have started reopening their buildings. But the business of assessing properties, paying fines and running America\u2019s cities looks little like it did before the pandemic.\n\nIn Aurora, Ill., City Hall was set to open just three days a week, with the first hour each day set aside for older residents. In Detroit\u2019s partly reopened municipal center, appointments were recommended, employees were being tested for the virus and workers were no longer accepting cash payments. And in Dayton, Ohio, where City Hall had been closed since March 18, it was set to reopen this week with hand-sanitizing stations and security guards performing temperature checks.\n\nEven with their front doors unlocked, cities were not exactly encouraging visitors. Officials in Buffalo, who also planned to reopen, said residents with a temperature over 100.4 degrees would not be allowed inside. Detroit officials planned to offer curbside service. Dayton\u2019s news release announcing its reopening included an explicit suggestion to not come:\n\n\u201cThe City of Dayton is encouraging customers to continue conducting business with the city remotely and electronically, as physical distancing standards are practiced at city facilities and many employees continue to work from home,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDelta, United and Southwest sign deal for Treasury loans.\n\nAll four of the large U.S. airlines have agreed to terms for loans from the federal government under the March stimulus bill, the Treasury Department said Tuesday.\n\nDelta Air Lines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines signed letters of intent under that law, known as the CARES Act, Treasury said. Last week, the department announced that American Airlines had agreed to a five-year $4.75 billion loan.", "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nToday: For months, the U.S. government has been quietly collecting information on hundreds of thousands of coronavirus cases across the country. My colleague, Robert Gebeloff, on the story of how The Times obtained that data. It\u2019s Wednesday, July 8. Robert, you live in a corner of The Times, the data team, that I\u2019m not sure most people understand all that well. So when the pandemic starts, how do you all respond?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo, by training, my goal is to find stories that can best be told through data, which is not every story, but there\u2019s a lot of stories out there. So if you go back to early March, the pandemic is starting. And I know that our job as The New York Times is to really get our arms around what\u2019s going on and, by that, to start collecting the data that is starting to come out about cases and deaths around the country. So my colleagues set up a team of people across different departments whose primary job would be to monitor all the states, all the major counties, and gather the information and start to build a database. Start to say, we\u2019re getting information from New York over here and California over here, but let\u2019s put it into one database just for the purpose of tracking where the cases were, where the deaths were.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s not coming out on a national level. There\u2019s no big clearinghouse that\u2019s going to hand you data every day about exactly where the virus is all across the country.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nCorrect. And at that point, we assume that some kind of federal system may be in the offing, but we weren\u2019t going to wait for it. And part of our report every day, you\u2019ll see on our website, are maps showing where the cases are, where new cases are, where deaths are, where the new hotspots are. That all emanated from these early days of creating this ground-level system for being able to collect this data.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I wonder if you can take me into the process of that a little bit. I mean, what does it look like? Where exactly is the information coming from?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, it\u2019s really like a hive of activity. I mean, that\u2019s the way I like to think of it. You have, at any given time, a team of clerks, reporters, editors, all assigned to monitor what gets announced in various parts of the country. So at one moment, you could have somebody wrestling with new data that was put out by California and trying to get it into a format that matches our data standards. And you could have somebody in Mississippi confused about whether the new data announced is cumulative, or is it new cases for the day? And often, that involves basic reporting of going back to the state and asking questions. Then, while all this is going on and people are collecting this data, we have other people trying to put the data into context. It\u2019s, you know, truly this whole new full-time operation just devoted to trying to track what is really happening with the pandemic and to do some surveillance on the national picture.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. This sounds very tedious, incremental. You know, gathering up tiny bits of data, cleaning it, making sure it all lines up \u2014 not sexy.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nIt is not sexy at all. You know, when you\u2019re data journalists, the fun part is doing what we call the queries \u2014 asking questions of the data and seeing what it shows. But we all know, like, job one is to make sure your data is good. Otherwise, the questions you ask won\u2019t mean anything.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. And what do you begin to learn through this data?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nRight. Part of what my personal job is to do is to look at this data and try and help understand what it tells us. So, for example, one of the early findings we had when we were looking at the pandemic in March was it seemed to be hitting mostly in big cities \u2014 New York, New Orleans, Detroit.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSeattle.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSeattle. It seemed to be in places with a lot of population density. But there was also another class of place that seemed to be popping up. And it was resort counties \u2014 places with ski resorts. And so that led us to this insight that it wasn\u2019t just population density, that there are other possible explanations for why places got hit. Then, as the weeks went on, we began to see the fill-in, what I call the fill-in, which is \u2014 there were all of these new counties that were starting to get cases. And so by having this record, what we were able to then report is there are now hundreds of rural counties getting their first cases. And, you know, how were they preparing? And how were they talking to people? And then, another thing we\u2019ve been monitoring is there seems to be this ideological difference \u2014 or at least there has been \u2014 about how serious a problem is it. How soon should government reopen or allow businesses to reopen? And \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Kind of a red state-blue state divide over shutting down and reopening.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nRight. But our reporting showed that there was this additional element involved, which was, for the first six to eight weeks of the pandemic, there were hardly any red counties with high infection rates. And most of the hard-hit places were in blue counties. And so we were able to raise the specter of, if you live in a place that doesn\u2019t have first-hand experience with the virus, you don\u2019t have your emergency rooms being overflowed. Maybe that also contributes to your belief that, you know what, we should open the economy. This is not worth shutting down the economy for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd all of these types of stories are, again, driven by the idea that in the first place, we had good county-level data that we couldn\u2019t get anywhere else. That allowed us to look at the world through these different prisms and ask different questions about how the pandemic was playing out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. You\u2019re laying out clear examples of why data like this is important and what it lets us understand. But I\u2019m curious what the limitations of this kind of a database are. What does it not tell us?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nYeah. So think of it this way. A data set we think of like any other source that we\u2019re going to interview. And we think of what might this source be able to tell us about something. And so we think of questions that we\u2019re going to ask the source. So the problem became \u2014 we had this data set, and we knew where the cases were and the deaths were, but we couldn\u2019t ask it any other questions. We couldn\u2019t ask, who were the people actually becoming infected in these counties? Were they old? Were they young? Where they rich? Were they poor? Were they front-line workers? Were they white? Were they Black? Were they Latino? So all these questions we had we couldn\u2019t really ask the data set we had.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what did you end up doing?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo, along the way, we learned that the C.D.C. actually had some information that would be helpful in this, in that every time a person was confirmed to have a coronavirus infection, the local health agency would fill out a report that would have characteristics of the case \u2014 the person, the age, the race. And the form actually asked dozens of questions. You know, was the person at work? Was the person staying home? What were the symptoms? And that these forms ultimately ended up at the C.D.C.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd if we could get our hands on this data, we could ask a lot more questions about how this pandemic is playing out. And so we decided to approach the C.D.C. and request access. And here\u2019s why we needed that data. So many people in this country are getting sick. So many people are dying. And our job is to try and explain, who is it that is getting sick? Who is dying and why? And if we had any chance of getting answers to those questions, we need the best data. And if the C.D.C. had the data, we wanted to get a copy ourselves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how do you go about trying to get it?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, in this case, we ended up suing them.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So, Robert, why did The New York Times sue the C.D.C.?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo suing the C.D.C. sounds very dramatic. But in fact, many, many times in the course of a year, we go to court to establish our rights to get public information. It\u2019s somewhat more routine than most people would realize. And sometimes it\u2019s because the government out and out refuses to give up the information. But in this case, it was more to do with the timing. Without going to court and putting pressure on the agency, we were looking at the prospect of waiting months to get our hands on this information.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nBut by going to court, it sort of put the clock on. And we had the agency\u2019s full attention.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so what ends up happening once this clock is ticking and a judge is looking over the shoulders of the C.D.C.?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo the C.D.C. tells us that they will comply. They just need to do a little more research as to what they can possibly produce, taking into consideration the privacy of people who are in the database and stripping out personally identifiable information. But ultimately, the day comes where they say, OK, New York Times, here is a database of 1.45 million cases \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\n\u2014 that we have collected from state and local authorities. And we were then free to have a new interview subject and be able to ask it a whole lot of more interesting and detailed questions.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I mean, this quite literally sounds like the motherlode of data on this pandemic in the United States.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, in many ways it was. What we were able to see from this was detailed information about individuals who had become infected and died. And for each individual, we were able to look at their age, the county they lived in, their race and their ethnicity. And that is far more information than we had before. And in the end, we ended up being able to break down cases for nearly 1,000 counties covering more than half of the U.S. population.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd this number \u2014 1.5 million Americans \u2014 how big a proportion of all cases of the virus is that?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo for the time period covered by the data \u2014 it was all cases through the end of May \u2014 it was about 88 percent of all cases that we had some information about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you get this massive data dump, what do you do? What do you find?\n\n[music]\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo when we finally had our hands on this data, we were checking what types of information were included, how complete the information was, and just looking at the data in many different ways to see what it could tell us. And eventually, three main trends emerged.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so what were those trends?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo the first was just how pervasive the racial disparity was with this pandemic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWhatever knowledge people had that African-Americans and Latinos were becoming infected at a higher rate, a lot of that was tied to big cities that had released data. But what we found is that this racial disparity pervades everywhere, whether you go from cities to suburbs, even into rural places.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nIn fact, any place we found where there was a significant African-American population, almost all of them, African-American infection rates were higher than the rate for Whites. Same thing with Latinos. Any place we found where there was a significant Latino population, for almost all of them, the infection rate was higher for Latinos.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThe second big takeaway is what is driving these racial disparities. So most of the earliest explanations of the racial disparity were focused on death rates. And one of the explanations for the disparities in death rates that is commonly offered is something called comorbidities \u2014 the idea that African-Americans might be dying at a higher rate because they were more likely to have preexisting conditions or to be in poorer health to begin with. But in our analysis, we focused mostly on the actual infection rates. And the reason for that is that gets us out of the question of whether comorbidities is driving it and puts us more on the question of who is most at risk to become infected in the first place. And so when we see disparities in the infection rates, we can then raise the question of, why are people in certain groups more likely to become infected?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd that led us to looking at, where do people work? Where do people live? And what is their housing situation? And if you look at where people work and look at what the data shows, it shows that African-Americans and Latinos in the U.S. are far less likely to have the kind of job where you can do it at home. They are more likely, instead, to have a job in the production sector, in a factory or in the service sector. All of that combined would increase your risk of becoming infected. And with housing, what we found is that Latinos in particular are far more likely to live either with more people in the household or with less space in the household, both of which would also increase the odds of a person might become infected.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the second discovery very much helps understand the first. There are kind of structural issues around how Black and Latino Americans work and live that contribute to this racial disparity in the pandemic.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThat\u2019s correct. And the third takeaway from this is what you learn by looking at the pandemic through the prism of age.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nRight now, most of what we know about the disparity is all cases of people of all age groups. And that\u2019s how the rates are calculated. But if you realize something about this pandemic, it\u2019s that older people are far more likely to get sick and die.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd in the U.S. right now, the older population is very disproportionately white, non-Hispanic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo if you don\u2019t account for age, you\u2019re by definition almost understating the disparity. So what we did \u2014 what some epidemiologists call \u201cage adjusting\u201d \u2014 is looked at infection rates across age groups. And when you look at, say, what the infection rate is for people who are in their 40s or in their 50s, the disparity is much bigger than you\u2019ll ever see in numbers without age adjustment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you accounted for the fact that so many older people have died from the coronavirus, and that the older population in this country skews white, you found that the racial disparity actually gets even greater.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nCorrect. In fact, if you look at some of the younger age groups, the death rate for Latinos is about 10 times higher that for whites.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nNow, the caveat to that, of course, is you\u2019re much, much less likely to die at those age groups. But it\u2019s still, among the people who do die in those age groups, it\u2019s very heavily Black and Latino.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I mean, these insights, once again, seem to highlight just how important it is to have this kind of information. Because from what you\u2019re saying, we have been, in some sense, misunderstanding the racial disparities of this virus \u2014 the causes of the racial disparities \u2014 because we haven\u2019t had access to this data.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, at minimum, you could say we didn\u2019t know the extent to which these problems existed. And getting data like this helps us sort of define what the ground truth is about how this pandemic is playing out. That being said, there\u2019s still a lot more that we would like to know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThe database had 1.45 million records. And it had, for each record, more than 100 columns or 100 pieces of information. Most of those were blank. And that leaves us in the dark about a lot of questions that we\u2019d like answered, like how many people are contracting the virus at work? Or how many are getting it from traveling or being at bars? So still a lot of room for improvement. And hopefully, knowing what can be done, the power of having this data to answer questions will help inspire the C.D.C. to collect the information better.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. And perhaps release it more quickly. I have to think that suing the C.D.C., getting this data and reporting out these insights on race has increased pressure on the federal government to make this information more available. Is that true?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nI would like to think so. There is still some mystery as to what will ultimately happen. Our case is still pending. The status is, the C.D.C. at this point believes they satisfied our request.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nOur lawyers are still investigating whether or not there was more information that should have been released \u2014 or more types of information. And, you know, once that is resolved, the question will be what does the C.D.C. do going forward. And a lot of people, in reaction to the story that published, were asking me, do you think they\u2019ll just start posting this on their own? And I would think that whether or not the information is complete, it\u2019s still better than anything else out there. And so hopefully we will see more of this type of information made public.\n\n[music]\n\nThat would definitely be beneficial to not just us, but to researchers around the nation and the world to have access to more complete and better information. But until that happens, we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing. We\u2019re going to go out every day, go to every state and collect data on coronavirus cases and deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRob, thank you very much.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday, the latest updates to The Times\u2019s database found that the virus has infected more than 3 million Americans and has killed more than 130,000 of them. Globally, it recorded nearly 12 million infections and nearly 542,000 deaths, including 65,000 in Brazil, where the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly downplayed the pandemic and avoided wearing a mask, announced that he had tested positive for the virus. We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmission control Station, this is Houston. Are you ready for the event? chris cassidy Hello, Houston. We\u2019re ready for the event.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n38 days ago, NASA and SpaceX launched two U.S. astronauts into space on a mission to the International Space Station, where they joined a fellow American. It was the first time that a manned spacecraft has left American soil in nearly a decade.\n\nmission control The New York Times, this is mission control Houston. Please call station for a voice check.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday, I spoke with the three U.S. astronauts now aboard the space station.\n\nchris cassidy Hello, New York Times. New York Times, this is the International Space Station. How do you hear us?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBob Behnken and Doug Hurley, who arrived a few weeks ago, along with Chris Cassidy, who has been there since April.\n\nmichael barbaro We hear you loud and clear. How do you hear us? chris cassidy We hear you loud and clear as well. Good afternoon. Welcome aboard, and we\u2019re happy to talk to you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course, their time in space is precious. And so NASA gave us six minutes on the dot.\n\nmichael barbaro If I might boldly call you by your first names \u2014 Doug, Chris and Bob \u2014 thank you very much for making time for us. I wonder if you can start by telling us exactly where you are in space, relative to us right now. chris cassidy Well, while I kick things off, Bob\u2019s going to pull up our mapping program. Right at the moment, we didn\u2019t have it on the computer. Sorry about that. But we\u2019re orbiting 250 miles above the Earth. And it looks like we are abeam of Baja California, just a little bit out into the Pacific Ocean. michael barbaro Mm-hmm. So over America \u2014 the U.S.-Mexico border. chris cassidy Right. Yeah. We\u2019re just over the Pacific Ocean. We just past California heading south. michael barbaro If you\u2019ll indulge me for a minute, I want to talk a little bit about feelings. Knowing I was going to be talking to you, I have been thinking a lot about this moment back on Earth and wondering, with so much turmoil here, and you looking down on all of it from such a distance, what that feels like to look down on a planet that\u2019s truly in the midst of some really challenging, tumultuous times. doug hurley Well, it certainly is challenging to hear, either by secondhand or when we get the opportunity to see some news up here, all the turmoil that\u2019s going on. The challenges with the pandemic and the strife in the cities and all the different challenges that people are going through on a day-to-day basis. It is \u2014 you know, emotionally it does take a toll on us, certainly. And I think the other thing that really resonates with me, personally, is just when you look out the window, when you see the planet below, you don\u2019t see borders. You don\u2019t see this strife. You see this beautiful planet that we need to take care of. And hopefully, as technology advances and as this commercial space travel gets going, more people will get that opportunity. Because I think if you get the chance to look out the window from space and look back on our planet, it will change you. It will change you for the better. And you\u2019ll realize that this is one big world, rather than all these different little countries or cities or factions that we have on the planet. And I think it will make it a better place. michael barbaro Well, that\u2019s really interesting. And I wonder if you could say a little bit more about that, because in the time since I believe you\u2019ve all last been in space, there actually have been changes on Earth. You know, major ice shelves have broken off in Antarctica. Huge fires have swept across Australia, California. The Great Barrier Reef has essentially died. And when you look down at Earth, can you actually see some of those changes to the Earth, compared with when you last saw it? bob behnken Well, I think one of the things that we see from up here is that the Earth is not a stagnant place. It continues to change, whether it\u2019s a fire, whether it\u2019s the seasons, whether it\u2019s different things happening further out. You know, we just saw a comet become visible in the predawn era. So it\u2019s definitely a lot of things happening with the Earth and \u2014 michael barbaro Wow. bob behnken \u2014 that continuous change. michael barbaro I have to apologize. Now I need for you to tell me what it means for a comet to become visible in the predawn era and what that actually looks like. bob behnken The comet that I\u2019m referring to was really close to the sun. And so it needed to get far enough away from the sun that we could actually, you know, look at it and see its dim little light that was visible in darkness, but kind of blinded by the sun, if you will, if you look too closely at it. And so if we got to a situation at dawn, right before the sun came up, that comet became visible during that short period of time when it was still close to the sun, but the sun was still hidden by the Earth. It was just an awesome sight to be able to see and something that we try to capture. In the few moments that we do have to look out the window, we try to capture those changes. Capture the exciting things that we can see to try to share our view with the folks back home, the folks that are still down on Earth, and just try to give them an appreciation for just how beautiful our planet is and how important it is that we do our best to take care of it.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro But in terms of that turmoil \u2014 mission control Station, this is Houston ACR.

Thank you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro", "To the Editor:\n\n\u201cColleges Face Rising Revolt by Professors\u201d (front page, July 3) conjures images of troublesome faculty members undermining educational hopes and dreams by recalcitrantly digging in their heels, and suggests a false opposition between the goals of the faculty and those of students. Quite the opposite is true.\n\nFaculty members want to be back in classrooms, as do students. But we also do not want to endanger ourselves, our families, our colleagues. We worry about our students; recent data suggests that large numbers of those testing positive are now college age. While the virus seems most deadly in older demographics, there are ample cases in which it has proved very serious or even fatal in younger people.\n\nTeachers know their students; they know their campuses. Some are, with reason, concerned about how the best-laid plans for a socially distanced term could fall apart when students recongregate in the fall term. Some of us are also concerned about bringing large numbers of students from regions that have become hot spots back to places, like New York, that have managed to flatten the curve. What is the responsibility of the university to its broader community?\n\nThere are no easy answers to any of these questions, as any faculty member or administrator could tell you. But by framing the issue as a revolt by professors, The Times treats a national issue that affects us all in a way that appears to trivialize the genuine concerns faculty members have for their health, that of their students, families, and communities, and the quality of the work to which they are devoted."], "20200708": ["Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has said he is open to a \u201cfinal\u201d relief bill that would cover some of the expenses of opening schools safely. \u201cWe can\u2019t get back to normal if the kids are not back in school,\u201d he said this week.\n\nExactly how much money the nation\u2019s schools need to reopen is a matter of debate, complicated by the conflicting, sometimes shifting advice and guidelines that administrators have received from government agencies and medical authorities.\n\nIn May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that remote learning was the safest option, and that students in classrooms should remain six feet apart \u201cwhen feasible.\u201d A six-foot requirement would mean that many schools could accommodate half of their students or fewer at any given time.\n\nGiven that, many systems planned a hybrid approach, with students splitting their time between classrooms and remote learning. On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said students in the nation\u2019s largest school district would most likely attend only one to three days per week if schools open in September.\n\nThe Trump administration has promoted an alternate set of guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics that suggest three feet of physical distance may be sufficient in classrooms if students wear masks.\n\nRegardless of which recommendations are followed, reopening schools will require changes. An average-size district of 3,700 students can expect $1.8 million in pandemic-related costs for 2020-21, representing 3 to 4 percent of a typical annual budget, according to an estimate from AASA, the School Superintendents Association. Districts say they typically operate on tight budgets, and even more so this year as state and local tax revenues run low.\n\nBut some experts have suggested that much of what schools are planning for the fall, such as checking students\u2019 symptoms before they board buses or enter schools, is unnecessary, akin to the type of \u201csecurity theater\u201d Americans became accustomed to after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 reassuring, but often providing only superficial protection.", "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nToday: For months, the U.S. government has been quietly collecting information on hundreds of thousands of coronavirus cases across the country. My colleague, Robert Gebeloff, on the story of how The Times obtained that data. It\u2019s Wednesday, July 8. Robert, you live in a corner of The Times, the data team, that I\u2019m not sure most people understand all that well. So when the pandemic starts, how do you all respond?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo, by training, my goal is to find stories that can best be told through data, which is not every story, but there\u2019s a lot of stories out there. So if you go back to early March, the pandemic is starting. And I know that our job as The New York Times is to really get our arms around what\u2019s going on and, by that, to start collecting the data that is starting to come out about cases and deaths around the country. So my colleagues set up a team of people across different departments whose primary job would be to monitor all the states, all the major counties, and gather the information and start to build a database. Start to say, we\u2019re getting information from New York over here and California over here, but let\u2019s put it into one database just for the purpose of tracking where the cases were, where the deaths were.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s not coming out on a national level. There\u2019s no big clearinghouse that\u2019s going to hand you data every day about exactly where the virus is all across the country.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nCorrect. And at that point, we assume that some kind of federal system may be in the offing, but we weren\u2019t going to wait for it. And part of our report every day, you\u2019ll see on our website, are maps showing where the cases are, where new cases are, where deaths are, where the new hotspots are. That all emanated from these early days of creating this ground-level system for being able to collect this data.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I wonder if you can take me into the process of that a little bit. I mean, what does it look like? Where exactly is the information coming from?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, it\u2019s really like a hive of activity. I mean, that\u2019s the way I like to think of it. You have, at any given time, a team of clerks, reporters, editors, all assigned to monitor what gets announced in various parts of the country. So at one moment, you could have somebody wrestling with new data that was put out by California and trying to get it into a format that matches our data standards. And you could have somebody in Mississippi confused about whether the new data announced is cumulative, or is it new cases for the day? And often, that involves basic reporting of going back to the state and asking questions. Then, while all this is going on and people are collecting this data, we have other people trying to put the data into context. It\u2019s, you know, truly this whole new full-time operation just devoted to trying to track what is really happening with the pandemic and to do some surveillance on the national picture.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. This sounds very tedious, incremental. You know, gathering up tiny bits of data, cleaning it, making sure it all lines up \u2014 not sexy.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nIt is not sexy at all. You know, when you\u2019re data journalists, the fun part is doing what we call the queries \u2014 asking questions of the data and seeing what it shows. But we all know, like, job one is to make sure your data is good. Otherwise, the questions you ask won\u2019t mean anything.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. And what do you begin to learn through this data?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nRight. Part of what my personal job is to do is to look at this data and try and help understand what it tells us. So, for example, one of the early findings we had when we were looking at the pandemic in March was it seemed to be hitting mostly in big cities \u2014 New York, New Orleans, Detroit.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSeattle.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSeattle. It seemed to be in places with a lot of population density. But there was also another class of place that seemed to be popping up. And it was resort counties \u2014 places with ski resorts. And so that led us to this insight that it wasn\u2019t just population density, that there are other possible explanations for why places got hit. Then, as the weeks went on, we began to see the fill-in, what I call the fill-in, which is \u2014 there were all of these new counties that were starting to get cases. And so by having this record, what we were able to then report is there are now hundreds of rural counties getting their first cases. And, you know, how were they preparing? And how were they talking to people? And then, another thing we\u2019ve been monitoring is there seems to be this ideological difference \u2014 or at least there has been \u2014 about how serious a problem is it. How soon should government reopen or allow businesses to reopen? And \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Kind of a red state-blue state divide over shutting down and reopening.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nRight. But our reporting showed that there was this additional element involved, which was, for the first six to eight weeks of the pandemic, there were hardly any red counties with high infection rates. And most of the hard-hit places were in blue counties. And so we were able to raise the specter of, if you live in a place that doesn\u2019t have first-hand experience with the virus, you don\u2019t have your emergency rooms being overflowed. Maybe that also contributes to your belief that, you know what, we should open the economy. This is not worth shutting down the economy for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd all of these types of stories are, again, driven by the idea that in the first place, we had good county-level data that we couldn\u2019t get anywhere else. That allowed us to look at the world through these different prisms and ask different questions about how the pandemic was playing out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. You\u2019re laying out clear examples of why data like this is important and what it lets us understand. But I\u2019m curious what the limitations of this kind of a database are. What does it not tell us?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nYeah. So think of it this way. A data set we think of like any other source that we\u2019re going to interview. And we think of what might this source be able to tell us about something. And so we think of questions that we\u2019re going to ask the source. So the problem became \u2014 we had this data set, and we knew where the cases were and the deaths were, but we couldn\u2019t ask it any other questions. We couldn\u2019t ask, who were the people actually becoming infected in these counties? Were they old? Were they young? Where they rich? Were they poor? Were they front-line workers? Were they white? Were they Black? Were they Latino? So all these questions we had we couldn\u2019t really ask the data set we had.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what did you end up doing?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo, along the way, we learned that the C.D.C. actually had some information that would be helpful in this, in that every time a person was confirmed to have a coronavirus infection, the local health agency would fill out a report that would have characteristics of the case \u2014 the person, the age, the race. And the form actually asked dozens of questions. You know, was the person at work? Was the person staying home? What were the symptoms? And that these forms ultimately ended up at the C.D.C.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd if we could get our hands on this data, we could ask a lot more questions about how this pandemic is playing out. And so we decided to approach the C.D.C. and request access. And here\u2019s why we needed that data. So many people in this country are getting sick. So many people are dying. And our job is to try and explain, who is it that is getting sick? Who is dying and why? And if we had any chance of getting answers to those questions, we need the best data. And if the C.D.C. had the data, we wanted to get a copy ourselves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how do you go about trying to get it?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, in this case, we ended up suing them.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So, Robert, why did The New York Times sue the C.D.C.?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo suing the C.D.C. sounds very dramatic. But in fact, many, many times in the course of a year, we go to court to establish our rights to get public information. It\u2019s somewhat more routine than most people would realize. And sometimes it\u2019s because the government out and out refuses to give up the information. But in this case, it was more to do with the timing. Without going to court and putting pressure on the agency, we were looking at the prospect of waiting months to get our hands on this information.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nBut by going to court, it sort of put the clock on. And we had the agency\u2019s full attention.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so what ends up happening once this clock is ticking and a judge is looking over the shoulders of the C.D.C.?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo the C.D.C. tells us that they will comply. They just need to do a little more research as to what they can possibly produce, taking into consideration the privacy of people who are in the database and stripping out personally identifiable information. But ultimately, the day comes where they say, OK, New York Times, here is a database of 1.45 million cases \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\n\u2014 that we have collected from state and local authorities. And we were then free to have a new interview subject and be able to ask it a whole lot of more interesting and detailed questions.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I mean, this quite literally sounds like the motherlode of data on this pandemic in the United States.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, in many ways it was. What we were able to see from this was detailed information about individuals who had become infected and died. And for each individual, we were able to look at their age, the county they lived in, their race and their ethnicity. And that is far more information than we had before. And in the end, we ended up being able to break down cases for nearly 1,000 counties covering more than half of the U.S. population.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd this number \u2014 1.5 million Americans \u2014 how big a proportion of all cases of the virus is that?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo for the time period covered by the data \u2014 it was all cases through the end of May \u2014 it was about 88 percent of all cases that we had some information about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you get this massive data dump, what do you do? What do you find?\n\n[music]\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo when we finally had our hands on this data, we were checking what types of information were included, how complete the information was, and just looking at the data in many different ways to see what it could tell us. And eventually, three main trends emerged.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so what were those trends?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo the first was just how pervasive the racial disparity was with this pandemic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWhatever knowledge people had that African-Americans and Latinos were becoming infected at a higher rate, a lot of that was tied to big cities that had released data. But what we found is that this racial disparity pervades everywhere, whether you go from cities to suburbs, even into rural places.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nIn fact, any place we found where there was a significant African-American population, almost all of them, African-American infection rates were higher than the rate for Whites. Same thing with Latinos. Any place we found where there was a significant Latino population, for almost all of them, the infection rate was higher for Latinos.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThe second big takeaway is what is driving these racial disparities. So most of the earliest explanations of the racial disparity were focused on death rates. And one of the explanations for the disparities in death rates that is commonly offered is something called comorbidities \u2014 the idea that African-Americans might be dying at a higher rate because they were more likely to have preexisting conditions or to be in poorer health to begin with. But in our analysis, we focused mostly on the actual infection rates. And the reason for that is that gets us out of the question of whether comorbidities is driving it and puts us more on the question of who is most at risk to become infected in the first place. And so when we see disparities in the infection rates, we can then raise the question of, why are people in certain groups more likely to become infected?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd that led us to looking at, where do people work? Where do people live? And what is their housing situation? And if you look at where people work and look at what the data shows, it shows that African-Americans and Latinos in the U.S. are far less likely to have the kind of job where you can do it at home. They are more likely, instead, to have a job in the production sector, in a factory or in the service sector. All of that combined would increase your risk of becoming infected. And with housing, what we found is that Latinos in particular are far more likely to live either with more people in the household or with less space in the household, both of which would also increase the odds of a person might become infected.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the second discovery very much helps understand the first. There are kind of structural issues around how Black and Latino Americans work and live that contribute to this racial disparity in the pandemic.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThat\u2019s correct. And the third takeaway from this is what you learn by looking at the pandemic through the prism of age.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nRight now, most of what we know about the disparity is all cases of people of all age groups. And that\u2019s how the rates are calculated. But if you realize something about this pandemic, it\u2019s that older people are far more likely to get sick and die.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nAnd in the U.S. right now, the older population is very disproportionately white, non-Hispanic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nSo if you don\u2019t account for age, you\u2019re by definition almost understating the disparity. So what we did \u2014 what some epidemiologists call \u201cage adjusting\u201d \u2014 is looked at infection rates across age groups. And when you look at, say, what the infection rate is for people who are in their 40s or in their 50s, the disparity is much bigger than you\u2019ll ever see in numbers without age adjustment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you accounted for the fact that so many older people have died from the coronavirus, and that the older population in this country skews white, you found that the racial disparity actually gets even greater.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nCorrect. In fact, if you look at some of the younger age groups, the death rate for Latinos is about 10 times higher that for whites.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nNow, the caveat to that, of course, is you\u2019re much, much less likely to die at those age groups. But it\u2019s still, among the people who do die in those age groups, it\u2019s very heavily Black and Latino.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I mean, these insights, once again, seem to highlight just how important it is to have this kind of information. Because from what you\u2019re saying, we have been, in some sense, misunderstanding the racial disparities of this virus \u2014 the causes of the racial disparities \u2014 because we haven\u2019t had access to this data.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nWell, at minimum, you could say we didn\u2019t know the extent to which these problems existed. And getting data like this helps us sort of define what the ground truth is about how this pandemic is playing out. That being said, there\u2019s still a lot more that we would like to know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThe database had 1.45 million records. And it had, for each record, more than 100 columns or 100 pieces of information. Most of those were blank. And that leaves us in the dark about a lot of questions that we\u2019d like answered, like how many people are contracting the virus at work? Or how many are getting it from traveling or being at bars? So still a lot of room for improvement. And hopefully, knowing what can be done, the power of having this data to answer questions will help inspire the C.D.C. to collect the information better.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. And perhaps release it more quickly. I have to think that suing the C.D.C., getting this data and reporting out these insights on race has increased pressure on the federal government to make this information more available. Is that true?\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nI would like to think so. There is still some mystery as to what will ultimately happen. Our case is still pending. The status is, the C.D.C. at this point believes they satisfied our request.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nOur lawyers are still investigating whether or not there was more information that should have been released \u2014 or more types of information. And, you know, once that is resolved, the question will be what does the C.D.C. do going forward. And a lot of people, in reaction to the story that published, were asking me, do you think they\u2019ll just start posting this on their own? And I would think that whether or not the information is complete, it\u2019s still better than anything else out there. And so hopefully we will see more of this type of information made public.\n\n[music]\n\nThat would definitely be beneficial to not just us, but to researchers around the nation and the world to have access to more complete and better information. But until that happens, we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing. We\u2019re going to go out every day, go to every state and collect data on coronavirus cases and deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRob, thank you very much.\n\nrobert gebeloff\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday, the latest updates to The Times\u2019s database found that the virus has infected more than 3 million Americans and has killed more than 130,000 of them. Globally, it recorded nearly 12 million infections and nearly 542,000 deaths, including 65,000 in Brazil, where the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly downplayed the pandemic and avoided wearing a mask, announced that he had tested positive for the virus.

We\u2019re ready for the event.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n38 days ago, NASA and SpaceX launched two U.S. astronauts into space on a mission to the International Space Station, where they joined a fellow American. It was the first time that a manned spacecraft has left American soil in nearly a decade.\n\nmission control The New York Times, this is mission control Houston. Please call station for a voice check.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday, I spoke with the three U.S. astronauts now aboard the space station.\n\nchris cassidy Hello, New York Times. New York Times, this is the International Space Station. How do you hear us?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBob Behnken and Doug Hurley, who arrived a few weeks ago, along with Chris Cassidy, who has been there since April.\n\nmichael barbaro We hear you loud and clear. How do you hear us? chris cassidy We hear you loud and clear as well. Good afternoon. Welcome aboard, and we\u2019re happy to talk to you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course, their time in space is precious. And so NASA gave us six minutes on the dot.\n\nmichael barbaro If I might boldly call you by your first names \u2014 Doug, Chris and Bob \u2014 thank you very much for making time for us. I wonder if you can start by telling us exactly where you are in space, relative to us right now. chris cassidy Well, while I kick things off, Bob\u2019s going to pull up our mapping program. Right at the moment, we didn\u2019t have it on the computer. Sorry about that. But we\u2019re orbiting 250 miles above the Earth. And it looks like we are abeam of Baja California, just a little bit out into the Pacific Ocean. michael barbaro Mm-hmm. So over America \u2014 the U.S.-Mexico border. chris cassidy Right. Yeah. We\u2019re just over the Pacific Ocean. We just past California heading south. michael barbaro If you\u2019ll indulge me for a minute, I want to talk a little bit about feelings. Knowing I was going to be talking to you, I have been thinking a lot about this moment back on Earth and wondering, with so much turmoil here, and you looking down on all of it from such a distance, what that feels like to look down on a planet that\u2019s truly in the midst of some really challenging, tumultuous times. doug hurley Well, it certainly is challenging to hear, either by secondhand or when we get the opportunity to see some news up here, all the turmoil that\u2019s going on. The challenges with the pandemic and the strife in the cities and all the different challenges that people are going through on a day-to-day basis. It is \u2014 you know, emotionally it does take a toll on us, certainly. And I think the other thing that really resonates with me, personally, is just when you look out the window, when you see the planet below, you don\u2019t see borders. You don\u2019t see this strife. You see this beautiful planet that we need to take care of. And hopefully, as technology advances and as this commercial space travel gets going, more people will get that opportunity. Because I think if you get the chance to look out the window from space and look back on our planet, it will change you. It will change you for the better. And you\u2019ll realize that this is one big world, rather than all these different little countries or cities or factions that we have on the planet. And I think it will make it a better place. michael barbaro Well, that\u2019s really interesting. And I wonder if you could say a little bit more about that, because in the time since I believe you\u2019ve all last been in space, there actually have been changes on Earth. You know, major ice shelves have broken off in Antarctica. Huge fires have swept across Australia, California. The Great Barrier Reef has essentially died. And when you look down at Earth, can you actually see some of those changes to the Earth, compared with when you last saw it? bob behnken Well, I think one of the things that we see from up here is that the Earth is not a stagnant place. It continues to change, whether it\u2019s a fire, whether it\u2019s the seasons, whether it\u2019s different things happening further out. You know, we just saw a comet become visible in the predawn era. So it\u2019s definitely a lot of things happening with the Earth and \u2014 michael barbaro Wow. bob behnken \u2014 that continuous change. michael barbaro I have to apologize. Now I need for you to tell me what it means for a comet to become visible in the predawn era and what that actually looks like. bob behnken The comet that I\u2019m referring to was really close to the sun. And so it needed to get far enough away from the sun that we could actually, you know, look at it and see its dim little light that was visible in darkness, but kind of blinded by the sun, if you will, if you look too closely at it. And so if we got to a situation at dawn, right before the sun came up, that comet became visible during that short period of time when it was still close to the sun, but the sun was still hidden by the Earth. It was just an awesome sight to be able to see and something that we try to capture. In the few moments that we do have to look out the window, we try to capture those changes. Capture the exciting things that we can see to try to share our view with the folks back home, the folks that are still down on Earth, and just try to give them an appreciation for just how beautiful our planet is and how important it is that we do our best to take care of it.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro But in terms of that turmoil \u2014 mission control Station, this is Houston ACR.

They were recently deported from the United States, and they all had the coronavirus. Even as extreme measures were taken around the world to stop the spread of Covid-19, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, continue to detain people in the U.S., move them from state to state and then deport them to other countries. And with them, the virus. The New York Times in collaboration with The Marshall Project has interviewed sick detainees in ICE detention centers over the last four months. We\u2019ve tracked hundreds of domestic and international deportation flights. We\u2019ve spoken with airline staff who operate those flights. And we\u2019ve talked to Covid-positive deportees in Guatemala, El Salvador, India and Haiti. ICE says it has followed C.D.C. guidelines, but our investigation reveals how unsafe conditions and scattershot testing turned ICE into a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus, and how pressure from the Trump administration forced countries to take in sick deportees despite the risk. To understand how ICE spread the virus, let\u2019s first look at how its detention system works. On any given day, ICE holds tens of thousands of immigrants in a network of private facilities, state prisons and county jails across the U.S. Those detained include everyone from asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants to green card holders with deportable convictions. They\u2019re held in what\u2019s called civil detention while they wait for hearings to determine whether they can remain in the U.S. When detainees lose their immigration cases and are ordered deported, ICE will move them to other detention centers in Louisiana, Texas, Arizona or Florida. From there, immigrants are flown back to their home countries. \u201cToday, I am officially declaring a national emergency.\u201d Although President Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency on March 13, ICE continued to take immigrants from the community and detain them in facilities where conditions were ripe for the virus to spread. We talked to more than 30 detainees who described centers where social distancing was impossible, and where protective gear was not provided. Yudanys, an immigrant from Cuba, was first detained at the Catahoula Correctional Center in Louisiana while awaiting a decision on his asylum case. When Yudanys was at Catahoula, there was already a confirmed case of the virus \u2014 within a month 60 detainees were positive. He tested positive for Covid-19 in May. So far, ICE has confirmed at least 3,000 positive detainees, though testing has been limited. Even as detention centers became hotbeds for the virus, ICE regularly moved detainees around the U.S. We tracked over 750 domestic U.S. flights that carried thousands of detainees to different centers since a national emergency was declared. ICE contracts out these flights to a company called iAero, which operates Swift Air. A Swift flight attendant, who asked to remain anonymous, told us that detainees from different centers are collected and transported together. She and several other airline employees we spoke to said that these flights, which were under the direction of ICE, lacked protective measures for more than a month after the national emergency was declared. Swift Air declined to comment on this story. But ICE confirmed that the airline didn\u2019t have P.P.E. for all of its staff until mid-April. Kanate, a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, is one of those who was moved from place to place. He had been living in the U.S. for 20 years with his wife and two kids when he was detained in 2019. In April, Kanate was moved from the Pike County facility in Pennsylvania to Prairieland, Texas, even though he had been feeling sick. Kanate tested positive for the virus two days after arriving in Texas. ICE said its detention and transfer protocols follow C.D.C. guidelines. While ICE was moving sick detainees around the U.S., it was also deporting them to other countries and exporting the virus with them. We tracked over 200 deportation flights from March 13 through June, and confirmed that hundreds of detainees with Covid-19 were returned to 11 countries \u2014 all 11 had placed restrictions on their borders. But there could be many more infected deportees. ICE told us they\u2019ve deported almost 40,000 immigrants from 138 countries since March. Kanate told us that four of his dormmates either tested positive for Covid or had symptoms, but were deported to India anyway. One of them talked to us after he had arrived home. He asked to remain anonymous. He was one of 22 from his flight who tested positive upon arrival. Admild, an immigrant from Haiti, knew he had the virus even before being deported. He tested positive for Covid-19 while detained in Louisiana. He was put in quarantine and deported two weeks later. Admild said he still had symptoms days after landing. Of the hundreds of deportation flights we tracked, Central America was the region most affected. Nearly 60 percent of these flights went to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, all of which had closed their borders as they tried to contain the virus. The Guatemalan government said that 186 deportees had tested positive for Covid-19, so far. We spoke to Lourdes, who was one of 30 passengers on a single flight who tested positive after arriving. Lourdes was hospitalized a few days after landing. El Salvador on the other hand has said that no deportees arrived with the virus. But we spoke to Jorge, who said he started to feel sick while at the Catahoula Correctional Center in Louisiana before he was deported to El Salvador. He said he was one of 32 from his flight who tested positive. Hundreds of deportees are being held in quarantine centers like this one in El Salvador. Sources inside told us at least 10 Covid cases were confirmed in the centers. The Salvadoran government didn\u2019t reply to our request for comment. A key question in all of this is why some countries have continued to take in sick deportees while others have pushed back. The Trump administration has threatened governments with visa sanctions and cuts in humanitarian aid unless they complied with deportations. El Salvador and Honduras have accepted thousands of deportees since March, despite rising rates of Covid there and poor infrastructure to address the pandemic. In April, Trump praised the presidents of both countries for their cooperation, and said he would send ventilators. Guatemala was less compliant, and its president has been blunt. Guatemala asked the U.S. to test migrants, and it temporarily blocked flights. But three days after Trump threatened countries refusing to accept deportees, the flights to Guatemala resumed. ICE confirmed to us that they are only able to administer a sampling of tests before sending immigrants home. Still, the flights go on and sick detainees continue to be deported."], "20200710": ["The statue of the Hindu god Ganesha flashed onscreen for just seconds in the music video by Blackpink, an all-female K-pop band.

But by this year, something remarkable had happened.\n\nMs. Abello, now 39, finally had a home in a decent neighborhood. One of her daughters, Karol, was about to finish high school. Another, Nicol, was turning 15, and they were planning a party with a big dress and many guests. They were saving for a washing machine. Ms. Abello was proud of all she had accomplished.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and Ms. Abello lost her cleaning work. By May, she had been evicted, forcing her to move her children into a tin shed in an illegal settlement high above the city. At night, a bitter cold pushed its way in.

Here was a chance to glean a hint of whether her consciousness raising might have a meaningful effect within the world as we know it. The event was held in a gleaming space, with a bleached wood floor and brightly painted exposed pipes, a coffee cart and billboards featuring models of various races sporting the company\u2019s denim.\n\nThe turnout of around 45 employees \u2014 almost all of them white \u2014 felt sparse in the expansive room. Before DiAngelo got started, the director of Levi\u2019s diversity team at the time told me that the company\u2019s leadership probably wouldn\u2019t be in the audience. On another floor, the corporation was holding its first shareholders meeting since going public four months earlier. Levi\u2019s has a history of taking socially responsible stances; its motto is \u201cprofit through principles.\u201d But this morning, with the shareholders elsewhere, the leadership wouldn\u2019t be listening to DiAngelo.\n\nShe showed her facts and photographs and lectured on the supremacist worldview that, inevitably, saturates white people and seeps from our pores, and again, though this was my third DiAngelo session in as many days, I was moved. So was a high-level manager sitting near me; it turned out that there were, in the room, a handful of people in influential roles. \u201cI walked out with a heightened awareness of my white privilege,\u201d the manager said afterward, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know what Levi\u2019s was trying to accomplish \u2014 this was a miss for me.\u201d He had wide experience in the corporate world, and he commented, \u201cLike at most companies, we\u2019re lighter and lighter and lighter the higher you go.\u201d He didn\u2019t imagine this changing anytime soon, and when I called the diversity director to ask what Levi\u2019s hoped to gain from DiAngelo\u2019s workshop and how it would judge its progress on racial issues, I was told that the goal was \u201cto get conversations started\u201d but that to his knowledge the company kept no data reflecting diversity in senior positions or promotion rates by race. This was not unlike what I heard from Gore, whose spokeswoman praised DiAngelo\u2019s workshops there over the last few years but who insisted, as recently as this June, that Gore is \u201cnot traditionally hierarchical\u201d and so has no numbers on racial diversity in positions of control.\n\nIn the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s killing, Levi\u2019s, along with so many other institutions, put out a statement about the \u201cbrutal truth\u201d of both American racism and inequality inside its own \u201chouse.\u201d The company has booked another two sessions with DiAngelo. Perhaps more encouraging, it has pledged to be transparent about the racial makeup of the company\u2019s leadership. It just posted the data on its website. But less encouraging \u2014 despite a diversity program that was started three years ago \u2014 are the numbers themselves. Only 2 percent of the company\u2019s top 250 or so positions are filled by Black people, and the executive team and corporate board have no Black people at all, though the company has announced that it will fill its next opening on the board with a Black person. When I checked in with the high-level manager, he described the chief executive as caring earnestly about racial issues but also noted that this spring, during the pandemic, the company furloughed thousands of its low-level \u2014 and most diverse \u2014 workers, while the company chose to pay out dividends to shareholders, including to the chief executive, a reward of hundreds of thousands of dollars that he chose not to forgo.\n\nDiAngelo and Singleton are confident that the lessons they teach are the right ones, but about whether our society is on the verge of true racial progress, confidence comes and goes. Singleton talked in June about antiracism being pitted against the immense coupled forces of \u201cwhite dysconsciousness and power\u201d and told me that he hadn\u2019t watched the video of Floyd\u2019s killing, because \u201cI believe once I\u2019ve seen the video it will change the person I am. And the person I am is already too much for the society.\u201d He meant that his tone, if not his message, is reserved, and that if he watched the video, fury might overtake him. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s brother was lynched in the South,\u201d he said, and he immediately moved on, saying that he had to preserve his ability to \u201ccreate this human fabric,\u201d to stitch connections through understanding rather than rip things utterly apart. The video would take him \u201cto a level of doubting humanity, doubting that we can extract from humanity the disease of racism.\u201d\n\nDiAngelo hopes that her consciousness raising is at least having a ripple effect, contributing to a societal shift in norms. \u201cYou\u2019re watching network TV, and they\u2019re saying \u2018systemic racism\u2019 \u2014 that it\u2019s in the lexicon is kind of incredible,\u201d she said. So was the fact that \u201cyoung people understand and use language like \u2018white supremacy.\u2019\u201d She listed more evidence for optimism: \u201cIt\u2019s in the extent of the protests. It\u2019s in banning the confederate flag at NASCAR races. The renaming of military bases. Walmart agreeing to stop locking the ethnic hair-care products. We need a culture where a person who resists speaking up against racism is uncomfortable, and right this moment it looks like we\u2019re in that culture.\u201d\n\nYet she described a warning from her daily life in Seattle. \u201cI was in the supermarket the other day, and over the cheese section was a small sign saying, \u2018Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u201d Its lettering was childlike, in a cheery array of pink, green and blue, and it was plainly mass-produced. \u201cIt was like a Hallmark card,\u201d she said. The phrase floated above the meticulous display of provolone, fontina and Emmentaler, stripped of all power, a message of fleeting intent."], "20200715": ["Blind auditions are based on an appealing premise of pure meritocracy: An orchestra should be built from the very best players, period. But ask anyone in the field, and you\u2019ll learn that over the past century of increasingly professionalized training, there has come to be remarkably little difference between players at the top tier. There is an athletic component to playing an instrument, and as with sprinters, gymnasts and tennis pros, the basic level of technical skill among American instrumentalists has steadily risen. A typical orchestral audition might end up attracting dozens of people who are essentially indistinguishable in their musicianship and technique.\n\nIt\u2019s like an elite college facing a sea of applicants with straight A\u2019s and perfect test scores. Such a school can move past those marks, embrace diversity as a social virtue and assemble a freshman class that advances other values along with academic achievement. For orchestras, the qualities of an ideal player might well include talent as an educator, interest in unusual repertoire or willingness to program innovative chamber events as well as pure musicianship. American orchestras should be able to foster these values, and a diverse complement of musicians, rather than passively waiting for representation to emerge from behind the audition screen.\n\nSome leaders in the field I\u2019ve spoken with over the years have argued that the problem starts earlier than auditions. They say racial diversity is missing in the so-called pipeline that leads from learning an instrument to summer programs to conservatories to graduate education to elite jobs. In this view, even that strong pool of equally talented hypothetical auditioners might have few, if any, Black or Latino players in it.\n\nYet Afa S. Dworkin, the president of the Sphinx Organization, which is dedicated to encouraging diversity in classical music by fostering young artists, argues that the pipeline is not the problem, and that talented musicians of color are out there and ready.", "\u201cA museum official (or close relative) who loans an object to the museum for display then sells it after exhibition would likely earn an enhanced price for the object,\u201d said Greg Stevens, director of the Institute of Museum Ethics at Seton Hall University. \u201cAnd it would also cause the appearance of impropriety to arise \u2014 namely, that the museum used its prestige, resources, and reach to enrich the official.\u201d\n\nThe institute said it had engaged a Washington law firm to review the museum\u2019s loan procedures and policies to ensure that they had been followed.\n\nThe bond between museums and wealthy collectors is one of the essential relationships of American museums.

You sound great right now.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWonderful, wonderful. Hi. I\u2019m Jasmine Lombrage.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi, Jasmine. I\u2019m Michael Barbaro.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHi, nice \u2014 nice to meet you this way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nVery nice to meet you this way. Where exactly am I reaching you?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI am at the Bullfish Bar Plus Kitchen here in Baton Rouge, La.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s your restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo how long have you lived in Baton Rouge?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nMe, personally, about 17 years. My husband has been here over 20 years. And we have two girls, two beautiful girls, Gaby \u2014 she\u2019s turning 11 next month \u2014 and we have our gorgeous Angelle. She\u2019s nine.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow did you and your husband meet?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[LAUGHS] It\u2019s an old love story. We met at school. I was in dental hygiene school, and he was in culinary school. And he was working at that cafeteria. My friends said that they have good food over there, and they wanted to go. And so we went over there, and he was a quiet guy in the corner doing his own thing. I said, excuse me, what do you have here that is good and healthy that I can eat? And he looks up, and he said, Nothing is good enough for you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, jeez.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd then I turned to walk away, and he said, But if you come back tomorrow, I\u2019ll make something for you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd I just kind of smiled and said, No, thank you. And I had a few friends who are like, Yes, we\u2019re coming back tomorrow. So the next day, he made something for me. He made stir fry, and my friends \u2014 I had one of my crazy friends. She said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m not going to eat. I don\u2019t know if this guy is some kind of psycho or crazy and he\u2019s going to put something in my food. She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to eat. If nothing happens to me in a few minutes, then you \u2014 you can try it.\u201d So that\u2019s what happened. And he came back and asked, how was everything? I said, it was good. And then we started talking. Then \u2014 no then he said I\u2019m going to be his wife, and I said, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not going to happen. You know, and he said, well, he\u2019s a praying man. He always gets his heart desire.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, 10 years later, we ended up married.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you \u2014 when you two met, you were a dental hygienist student. He was training to be a chef.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how did you end up in the food industry?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, growing up, my mom always cooked, you know, for many people. So it was always a passion. I grew up cooking also with mom and just family and aunts. We just \u2014 that was just something we did. And then Angel, my husband, Chef Angel, my husband, you know, we \u2014 he was the executive corporate chef that started Voodoo BBQ & Grill, which is a restaurant here in the South. And he was known as the Pitmaster. And so what we did, we started Jazz City then, Jazz City was a catering company. And we were \u2014 he was like, well, this is what I love to do. And we wanted to do something \u2014 we have two young kids. We know that, you know, you can work hard for anyone and everyone, but really, if you want to leave that \u2014 create something for your family, you need to create something so that it can stay down and passed down for generations and generations and possibly grow. And that is our goal is to have it grow and flourish. And we ended up here at the Bullfish, and Bullfish was already \u2014 it was a restaurant previously owned by someone else. And when we came here, we made it our own by bringing new menu items. And this is the only place you can come in Louisiana and find an authentic Caribbean and Southern fusion cuisine. What he\u2019s done, what Chef has mastered, he\u2019s taken the fresh herbs that we have in the Caribbean, and then he\u2019s merged it with the wonderful spices that we have here in Louisiana. And he \u2014 there\u2019s a fusion of jerk, fish, and Southern barbecue shrimp.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. And the paella \u2014 you know, Chef makes a paella with \u2014 you know, he uses scallops. And the crawfish, which is from Louisiana, he infuses that with the andouille sausage, and then he puts the shrimp in there and the crab meat. And so it\u2019s just the different twist that he puts on all of the dishes. It\u2019s just magic in your mouth.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if you heard the music in the background a little. We kind of use a lot of Caribbean kind of music from different parts of the Caribbean, and we play different music from here. The vibe is just so, I don\u2019t need a passport, but I can get away here. Does that makes sense?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. It\u2019s funny you keep calling your husband \u201cchef.\u201d Is that how you refer to him?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAt work, we keep it professional. At home, well, when we get in a car, it\u2019s \u201choney.\u201d But when we\u2019re at work, we refer to each other \u2014 I refer to him as Chef, and he would just say whatever he had to say to me or, OK, yes, ma\u2019am, and that would be it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when did you take over the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThat was last year, 2019, May 22, 2019.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So just about \u2014 just about a year ago.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. And this restaurant, the Bullfish, it is personal for us, because our home is connected to the Bullfish.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. So that\u2019s why this pandemic \u2014 I personally have spent many nights not sleeping, because I know our home is connected to it. It\u2019s not like we have 5, 6, 7, 20 locations. This is all we have. In our home, we have two kids. My daughter, my oldest, Gaby, she\u2019s autistic. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but for now, she\u2019s depending on us to care for her. So as she grows, the home is \u2014 before we committed our home to the Bullfish \u2014 was part of the security blanket that we had. In the event something happened, she would have that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTell me what you mean when you say that your home is connected to Bullfish. You mean physically or emotionally or what?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, whenever you get a loan, you have to give some kind of guarantee, like a personal guarantee. And that\u2019s what we did, you know. We took that leap of faith and decided that we were going to put 100 percent in here to make it work. So we have to make the Bullfish work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if something were to happen to the restaurant, it would mean potentially losing your home?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd it sounds like that house is something you plan on passing on to your daughter, who\u2019s autistic.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, well, both of our girls, but we know her, at least, we can have somewhere for her in case she needed somewhere to be, and then we can have that there for her. That is something that always gets me emotional talking about, because \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[CRYING] I\u2019m sorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI understand.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nIt\u2019s \u2014 you know, and she\u2019s standing in front of me looking at me now. And we want to do whatever it takes to make it work. You know, we just have to make it work. So when this pandemic started, it really gave us a scare, because if we\u2019re not able to pay for everything, and we default on our loan, well, we understood the consequences, you know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWas there a moment when you felt that you had really kind of made it with this place, having bought it and started to make it your own?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. About a month before the pandemic, we were like, yeah, this was a good choice. My husband and I, we usually go to early morning service for church, and afterwards, we came here for brunch. And then before we were open, we had people waiting outside for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nIt was wonderful. And we were like, OK, wow, this is really going to work. This is really working. And wow, honey, this is our baby, and we\u2019re going to grow it, and we\u2019re going to be able to pay up the loan, and we\u2019re going to be able to just blow this thing out of the park. And then the pandemic started. And yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen did you first start to notice that the pandemic was impacting the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, early March \u2014 early March, because it was February was good with Valentine\u2019s Day. Early March is when everything started changing, and as March went on, the governor shut down the state. This is when, you know, you started losing staff members saying they\u2019re not coming out. I mean, you cannot blame them. We also started doing curbside delivery, and we were doing social media posts and putting up signs, handwritten signs offering discounts, letting people know that curbside pickup is available, just getting different yard signs made.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you have to put up signs in the windows or outside telling people, we\u2019re still around, you just need to call in.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, yes, yes. And then about maybe the second week after the state was closed, we would be lucky if we got two people that would call for curbside pickup. And we would just be sitting here the entire day, 11 to 8, and there\u2019s no one that would come by or no one that would call. So then I started calling the restaurant phone a couple of times to make sure the phone was working, because it never rang. We were there for hours.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you called the restaurant\u2019s main number with your cell phone just to see if it was working.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. [LAUGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd, you know, I started reaching out to third party \u2014 third party delivery providers to see if I can sign up with them, like Uber Eats and Waitr and DoorDash and ChowNow. And they\u2019re charging \u2014 some of them are charging from 25 percent to 35 percent.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPer order?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYeah, that\u2019s your food costs. Yes. You know, in addition to that, we\u2019re not able to buy in bulk anymore, because we\u2019ve wasted so much food. We\u2019ve thrown away so much stuff, so now we\u2019re having to go ourselves, Chef and I, to different mom and pop stores that are open, and we\u2019re having to purchase items. Of course, now you\u2019re paying more money for them, because you\u2019re not buying the same quantity anymore, and you\u2019re buying from a local retailer. So, you know, and then we have a bar here, and we weren\u2019t \u2014 no one was coming out to drink anymore, so that went away. So yeah, the pandemic, you know, it\u2019s been hard on us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. I\u2019m so sorry.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo with these delivery apps, these new sources of orders, how much money do you make off of any individual customer percentage-wise?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nRight now, you don\u2019t, because the fact that we\u2019re buying things from not just local distributors but smaller volume \u2014 we\u2019re buying things in smaller volume, so our profit margin is smaller. So we\u2019re basically not making anything. You\u2019re keeping the doors open, but you\u2019re not making anything from it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give us a sense of where your daughters have been throughout this period? At what point was their schooling interrupted?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nMaybe March. Angelle, when did school close? March or April?\n\nangelle lombrage\n\n[FAINT] It closed in March.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, school closed in March.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI used to bring my \u2014 I still do bring my two girls, so I can homeschool them, because school \u2014 they are out of school. So I use a corner of the restaurant, and I do schooling there for my girls. But it was a challenge. The change was not welcomed and open for the girls, especially my oldest, Gaby.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYou know, with autism, everything has to be \u2014 you need to have something \u2014 everything scheduled and everything has a plan you need to follow through. And this whole pandemic kind of just went haywire for her in the beginning. She was not sleeping. She was more agitated. And my youngest, Angelle, she kept saying she wanted to go back to school, so I had to find other ways to help them. So \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Jasmine, I think I hear your daughters in the background. Is that right?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, you do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you think there was a point where your daughters picked up on what has been happening for you and your husband, but beyond the stresses that they\u2019re experiencing, you know, from not being at school and social distancing, that they understood that you and your husband are struggling with this business and struggling financially?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI think so. There is one incident. My daughter, my youngest, she \u2014 you know, she gets allowance, and someone gives her money or whatever. And she saved the money, and one day, she wrote a note. And then she left a note on the bed, on my bed. I was taking a bath, and I came out, and she had a note saying that, Mom, I know you and Dad are working really hard, and things are really tough. I have some money saved. I hope this helps for you to pay for stuff.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, wow.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. That was hard. That was hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow old is this daughter who left you \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAngelle was 8 when she did that. She just turned 9 in April. So she had a pandemic birthday.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan I ask how much she gave you?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI think it was like $57 she had.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. And what did you do with it?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI still have it saved. I still have it there. I try not to use it. It was just such a touching moment, and just to see, you know, that they realize, kids realize more than you let them know. And knowing that they\u2019re here like almost every single day with me, and \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThey see everything.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow bad are things, financially speaking, right now?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nNot close at all to where we want to be. Not good at all. Not good at all. We have applied for a lot of, you know, small business loans, and we\u2019re just waiting to hear back.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you been able to cover all the payments that you owe to the bank?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI haven\u2019t. I think finance is one of the things people don\u2019t like to talk about, but I haven\u2019t been able to meet a lot of \u2014 I had to ask for abatements. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I mean, do you think there is a situation that you could imagine using that money from your youngest daughter, that $57?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI don\u2019t want to \u2014 I don\u2019t want to, because it\u2019s hers. Even though she gave it to me, it\u2019s hers. I do not want \u2014 I don\u2019t want to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI \u2014 I\u2019m just afraid to \u2014 I\u2019m just afraid to even think about a situation like that.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Jasmine, for listeners who don\u2019t know what the rules are in Louisiana, what was announced earlier this week?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, restaurants \u2014 commencing Friday, you can, restaurants can be open for 25 percent of the capacity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you can seat up to 25 percent of what would normally fit inside the restaurant. So how many people do you think that is?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, we can seat about 90 people comfortably in here. And so about 25 percent of that now is what we\u2019re allowed to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if you can only put, you know, 20 or so people inside, can you make money?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to happen, to be honest with you, because 20 percent \u2014 having 20 percent of people inside the business is not enough to sustain, and I don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to go on for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSo [SIGHS] it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a hard thing to digest right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut you have decided that you\u2019re going to let people back inside?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHonestly, me, personally, no. So it is still an open debate. We \u2014 actually, after I\u2019m done with this interview, we\u2019re going to sit down and weigh our options, the pros and the cons, and see if it\u2019s something that we want to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan I ask you what you see as the cons and the pros?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYeah, the pros \u2014 that, you know, we\u2019ll have 25 percent more revenue than what we\u2019re seeing now. And then the cons is knowing that someone will \u2014 I\u2019m afraid that, oh, my god, somebody\u2019s going to come out, and they\u2019re a carrier of Covid-19, and they infect somebody else. So I have no way of controlling that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you heard from customers about their opinions on whether it\u2019s time to go back inside the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, I have. I\u2019ve had mixed reviews. We tend to ask customers, whenever they\u2019re picking up or, are they ready for everything to open back up. That\u2019s normally the question we would ask. And I feel that I\u2019m getting more nos than yes, though, in my opinion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThose who have told you, Jasmine, that they do want to come out, what did they say is their reason for wanting to come out, to come back and eat in a restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThey want to get out of the house. You know, sometimes it\u2019s just the fact that you cannot do something makes you want to do it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] Yes. Yes, the forbidden fruit. Yes.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. My point, that\u2019s exactly. Like, oh, you tell me I cannot eat this? OK, I\u2019m going to. So yes, that\u2019s what I feel I\u2019m getting.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, for you, if you didn\u2019t run a restaurant, would you go out and eat right now? Would you walk into a restaurant, sit down, order food?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI would probably go out on a weekday, because weekdays are usually less busy, because I have a child that has a compromised immune system. So I\u2019m usually very careful to go out. I don\u2019t want to take something home to her, so that would be another reason that I personally will not go out. And if I did go out, minus my daughter\u2019s situation, I would have definitely found the seat \u2014 ask to be seated in the area that is far away from everybody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean it\u2019s interesting to hear you say that, that you wouldn\u2019t want to go to a restaurant unless it was specifically at a slow time because of the health of your daughter, because you\u2019re talking about yourself reopening a restaurant. So it\u2019s quite a weird conundrum.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, but it\u2019s honest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI just want to make sure I understand which of your daughters is immunocompromised.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nGaby is.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that the daughter who is autistic?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, because she was a former premature baby. I ruptured at 14 weeks when I was pregnant with her, and she had a lot of health challenges. They said, you know, that Gaby would never walk, talk, see, or hear. She was not via \u2014 she does not have any viability of life, and that she would never make it out of the hospital alive, you know. We were told that we were making a mistake for her. She coded, and it was even pronounced, and she came back. And she had a trach before, and she was on a ventilator before. She was on oxygen for the first \u2014 almost the first four years of her life. You know, she started talking late, walking late, and she had to do therapy, and, you know, she had a walker. So she had a lot of challenges to see where she is now and where she came from. So I\u2019m always careful, you know. A typical cold for you and I is just a cold, but for her, it can lead to pneumonia, or we\u2019ve lost her. We\u2019ve had her stop breathing a couple times, and nothing \u2014 I don\u2019t even know how to explain that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm. Given your daughter\u2019s health, are you worried that you\u2019re going to basically be in the kind of situation it sounds like you\u2019re afraid of kind of all the time, because people are going to be coming into your restaurant, and they could potentially get you sick, and you could potentially get your daughter sick?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. You know, I don\u2019t know what I would do if I find myself bringing something to my child. So I find myself in a very difficult position as a business owner.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat would be very hard to live with. I understand.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThat would \u2014 yes. You know \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, it sounds \u2014 it sounds like that \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 that has to \u2014 that has to be weighing on you as you\u2019re making this decision.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, it is. It is. It is. This is personal. This is not like, oh, OK, well, I\u2019m just going to open and make the money. It\u2019s not that situation for me. I have to be careful for it. I am responsible for her, and I\u2019m also responsible for my customers, making sure they have the best experience. And I\u2019m also responsible for my team that are coming to work. So \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd you\u2019re also responsible for that house \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 that is connected to this \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nRight!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 restaurant.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSo my hands are tied. Like, yes. It \u2014 yes, I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m just in a bind. Yeah, I\u2019m just in a bind right now. And say hi, Gaby.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSay hi. It\u2019s OK.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, I want to see you on the video. Nice to meet you, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nCan you see her? I don\u2019t know how this works.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I can see her. Yeah, she\u2019s got a great \u2014 she\u2019s got a leopard patterned sweater on.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. Are you going to talk?\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi. Gaby is waving.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI\u2019m doing well. Your mom was just telling us about you. She \u2014 she loves you.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. [LAUGHS] Yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe loves you \u2014 she loves you very much.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI do. I love you, Gab.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nI love you, too.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, that was \u2014 that was a nice gift.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, she walked up, so. [SIGH] I\u2019m sorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah, just give me a sec. Oof.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNo, I \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHence the reason why I\u2019m torn up. For someone that was 1 pound, 3 ounces when she was born, she is like \u2014 she\u2019s like \u2014 I mean she\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s doing so well. And then this is so scary.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThis is so scary, you know. And then it\u2019s a hard decision. I \u2014 we don\u2019t open up, then to get customers to come in, we\u2019re putting our house more at risk. We open up, and then something happens, then I\u2019m putting my child\u2019s life at risk. I don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to be me right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYep. I\u2019m going to be really eager \u2014 we\u2019re all going to be very eager to understand what decision you make. And I want you to know that we really enjoyed getting to know you and talking to you, and we\u2019re rooting for you and for your family.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you, and please give our best to your husband and to the rest of your family.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThank you.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nBye.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nGaby says bye.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBye, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSay bye.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nBye.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, thank you, guys.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBye.\n\n[music]\n\nHours after we spoke with Jasmine, she, her husband and their staff decided that they would reopen the restaurant for indoor dining. They then quickly changed their mind, delaying that service because of health concerns. Since then, infections have surged across Louisiana, more than doubling. As a result, the state has required that everyone over eight years old wear a mask or face covering when in public, closed all bars and capped indoor dining at 50 percent capacity. The Bullfish Bar and Kitchen, however, is still not open for indoor dining, but has continued outdoor service and takeout. After the episode aired, \u201cDaily\u201d listeners began reaching out to Jasmine with offers of financial support, with prayers and with food orders.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n(CRYING) I mean, the amount of calls. I would never forget the people that called from all over the world just to let us know that they\u2019re praying for us, they\u2019re with us and they\u2019re supporting us. And I\u2019m just so happy that mankind is \u2014 just so many good people in this world. I\u2019m just thankful. And I pray that the numbers decrease if we do our part as human beings to protect ourselves and protect each other so we can nip this virus in the bud, really. And bad things are happening. And I have no control over that. You have no control over that. But we have control of what we do, each person individually. And just showing me and my family and others that difficult does not mean impossible. You can\u2019t imagine how grateful and thankful I am. I\u2019m just \u2014 oh, my god. My family, we\u2019re so thankful.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJasmine\u2019s daughter Gaby turned 11 a few weeks ago, an event that the family celebrated with a socially distant party using Zoom. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that coronavirus infections are now increasing in 41 different states and that conditions nationwide are beginning to resemble the darkest days of the pandemic back in March. On Tuesday, California and Texas set new daily records with more than 10,000 new infections each. In both Texas and Florida, more than 130 people died, a record for both. And in Oklahoma on Wednesday \u2014\n\nkevin stitt It just kind of feels achy, like maybe the start of a little cold is what it feels like right now. But really, I feel fine.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe governor, Kevin Stitt, said that he had tested positive for the virus, becoming the nation\u2019s first governor to disclose an infection.\n\nkevin stitt So you just never know where it is. It\u2019s a virus that\u2019s in the United States. It\u2019s in Oklahoma. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s the new normal.\n\nmichael barbaro", "But, he suggested, \u201cin this moment we\u2019re at risk of giving short shrift to dealing with qualifications. You can try to be competitive by equipping yourself to run the race that\u2019s already scheduled, or you can try to change the race. There may be some things about the race I\u2019d like to change, but my priority is to get people prepared to run the race that\u2019s already scheduled.\u201d\n\nDiAngelo gave a presentation, last July, at Levi Strauss & Co.\u2019s corporate headquarters. Here was a chance to glean a hint of whether her consciousness raising might have a meaningful effect within the world as we know it. The event was held in a gleaming space, with a bleached wood floor and brightly painted exposed pipes, a coffee cart and billboards featuring models of various races sporting the company\u2019s denim.\n\nThe turnout of around 45 employees \u2014 almost all of them white \u2014 felt sparse in the expansive room. Before DiAngelo got started, the director of Levi\u2019s diversity team at the time told me that the company\u2019s leadership probably wouldn\u2019t be in the audience. On another floor, the corporation was holding its first shareholders meeting since going public four months earlier. Levi\u2019s has a history of taking socially responsible stances; its motto is \u201cprofit through principles.\u201d But this morning, with the shareholders elsewhere, the leadership wouldn\u2019t be listening to DiAngelo.\n\nShe showed her facts and photographs and lectured on the supremacist worldview that, inevitably, saturates white people and seeps from our pores, and again, though this was my third DiAngelo session in as many days, I was moved. So was a high-level manager sitting near me; it turned out that there were, in the room, a handful of people in influential roles. \u201cI walked out with a heightened awareness of my white privilege,\u201d the manager said afterward, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know what Levi\u2019s was trying to accomplish \u2014 this was a miss for me.\u201d He had wide experience in the corporate world, and he commented, \u201cLike at most companies, we\u2019re lighter and lighter and lighter the higher you go.\u201d He didn\u2019t imagine this changing anytime soon, and when I called the diversity director to ask what Levi\u2019s hoped to gain from DiAngelo\u2019s workshop and how it would judge its progress on racial issues, I was told that the goal was \u201cto get conversations started\u201d but that to his knowledge the company kept no data reflecting diversity in senior positions or promotion rates by race. This was not unlike what I heard from Gore, whose spokeswoman praised DiAngelo\u2019s workshops there over the last few years but who insisted, as recently as this June, that Gore is \u201cnot traditionally hierarchical\u201d and so has no numbers on racial diversity in positions of control.\n\nIn the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s killing, Levi\u2019s, along with so many other institutions, put out a statement about the \u201cbrutal truth\u201d of both American racism and inequality inside its own \u201chouse.\u201d The company has booked another two sessions with DiAngelo. Perhaps more encouraging, it has pledged to be transparent about the racial makeup of the company\u2019s leadership. It just posted the data on its website. But less encouraging \u2014 despite a diversity program that was started three years ago \u2014 are the numbers themselves. Only 2 percent of the company\u2019s top 250 or so positions are filled by Black people, and the executive team and corporate board have no Black people at all, though the company has announced that it will fill its next opening on the board with a Black person. When I checked in with the high-level manager, he described the chief executive as caring earnestly about racial issues but also noted that this spring, during the pandemic, the company furloughed thousands of its low-level \u2014 and most diverse \u2014 workers, while the company chose to pay out dividends to shareholders, including to the chief executive, a reward of hundreds of thousands of dollars that he chose not to forgo.\n\nDiAngelo and Singleton are confident that the lessons they teach are the right ones, but about whether our society is on the verge of true racial progress, confidence comes and goes. Singleton talked in June about antiracism being pitted against the immense coupled forces of \u201cwhite dysconsciousness and power\u201d and told me that he hadn\u2019t watched the video of Floyd\u2019s killing, because \u201cI believe once I\u2019ve seen the video it will change the person I am. And the person I am is already too much for the society.\u201d He meant that his tone, if not his message, is reserved, and that if he watched the video, fury might overtake him. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s brother was lynched in the South,\u201d he said, and he immediately moved on, saying that he had to preserve his ability to \u201ccreate this human fabric,\u201d to stitch connections through understanding rather than rip things utterly apart. The video would take him \u201cto a level of doubting humanity, doubting that we can extract from humanity the disease of racism.\u201d\n\nDiAngelo hopes that her consciousness raising is at least having a ripple effect, contributing to a societal shift in norms. \u201cYou\u2019re watching network TV, and they\u2019re saying \u2018systemic racism\u2019 \u2014 that it\u2019s in the lexicon is kind of incredible,\u201d she said. So was the fact that \u201cyoung people understand and use language like \u2018white supremacy.\u2019\u201d She listed more evidence for optimism: \u201cIt\u2019s in the extent of the protests. It\u2019s in banning the confederate flag at NASCAR races. The renaming of military bases. Walmart agreeing to stop locking the ethnic hair-care products. We need a culture where a person who resists speaking up against racism is uncomfortable, and right this moment it looks like we\u2019re in that culture.\u201d\n\nYet she described a warning from her daily life in Seattle. \u201cI was in the supermarket the other day, and over the cheese section was a small sign saying, \u2018Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u201d Its lettering was childlike, in a cheery array of pink, green and blue, and it was plainly mass-produced. \u201cIt was like a Hallmark card,\u201d she said. The phrase floated above the meticulous display of provolone, fontina and Emmentaler, stripped of all power, a message of fleeting intent."], "20200716": ["The question of when and how schools should reopen this fall has been a source of anguish and uncertainty for parents, students and educators. They are concerned about the health risks of full classrooms as the pandemic rages on, but are also often struggling with the professional and personal challenges posed by remote learning.\n\nA statement from the Biden campaign said that the former vice president \u201cbelieves that the decision about when to reopen safely should be made by state, tribal, and local officials, based on science and in consultation with communities and tribal governments. It should be made with the safety of students and educators in mind.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has favored a hard-line position, saying schools must reopen despite recommendations from federal experts, over a more nuanced approach, pursuing a pressure campaign in service of his demand.\n\nMr. Biden called for emergency funding for public schools and child-care providers \u2014 about $30 billion for school districts is needed, he suggested, and another $4 billion for upgraded technology and broadband. And he urged a \u201clarge-scale U.S. Department of Education\u201d effort to improve remote learning and smooth the reopening process.\n\nIn his proposal, Mr. Biden also recommended initiatives designed to close what his campaign described as \u201csystemic racial and socioeconomic disparities in education\u201d that have worsened during the pandemic.", "michael barbaro\n\nHey, there.

It looks like a blanket or a stuffed animal.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt\u2019s a blanket.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, what does it say on it?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt says powered by pizza.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd does it look like it has an image of pepperoni pizza on it? Is that I\u2019m glimpsing?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, pepperoni.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s pretty great. Well, Tilly, I really want to thank you for getting on the phone with us, or I guess this Google Hangout with us. And I wonder if you could tell me your full name and how old you are?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nMatilda Rose Breimhorst, and then I am 12.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. And I just want to start with a very simple question: How have you been feeling this past week?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, I\u2019m kind of in and out of moods usually. The two moods that I\u2019m mostly in are sad and angry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why do you think that you\u2019re sad and angry? What about?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI don\u2019t know we\u2019re \u2014 I feel like we\u2019re sad and angry because I think angry more that it\u2019s not fair that he\u2019s gone. And I feel like sad is really we\u2019re sad that he\u2019s gone and sad that we\u2019re being sad.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d More than 50,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus. One of them was Craig Breimhorst. Today, his granddaughter remembers him. It\u2019s Friday, May 1. I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about your grandfather. How would you describe your grandfather physically? What did he look like? What would he wear, those kind of things?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, well, he\u2019d wear pastor clothes and stuff.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWas he a pastor?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYes, he was a pastor. He used to be a mail man, and then he didn\u2019t like that job.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nAnd he had white hair, and then the mustache that goes right into the beard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nAnd when I was little, I played with his beard because it just felt so interesting touching it with my hands.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt felt all rough and scrapey, but like not too scrapey. He\u2019d wear glasses, and sometimes I stole his glasses. And he was like, Tilly, bring them back! And, like, whenever I walked into the house, he\u2019d just be like, Hoddy ho! I don\u2019t know where that came from, but it was just it\u2019s always something he said.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHoddy ho?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHoddy ho.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s more interesting than hello.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDid he have any kind of nickname for you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nTilly B was my one.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTilly B?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, \u2018cause for Breimhorst. They just called me Tilly B and and it kind of just rhymes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWait, what part? Which part rhymes?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nTilly, and then B. It\u2019s just kind of, like, it just goes together.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nTilly B.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTilly B.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. And then he\u2019d always make me happy. I\u2019d never, like, really get upset around him, unless I was hurt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nUnless you were hurt, you said.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, because we did all sorts of crazy things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWait, now, I need to understand some of the crazy things you did with him.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, well, he\u2019d take me out on the roof. Once we brought sleeping bags on the roof.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe roof of your house?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nNo, my grandpa\u2019s house, but we didn\u2019t tell my dad about it until afterwards.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. It sounds like he has a slightly mischievous quality to him.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you tell me about that? What was that like?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nWell, it would usually be like the middle of summer. And we would grab the stepladder, and open the window, pull up the screen, climb up onto the edge of the roof up to our special spot. Just laid there on the roof. And we just looked at the stars and talked for a while.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat kinds of things would your grandfather say?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, Here, Tilly, let\u2019s look for the Big Dipper, maybe the Milky Way if we\u2019re lucky, and Mars. I might be like, Wait, but isn\u2019t Mars a planet, not a star? He would just be like, But we can see it as a red star kind of.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nThe stars were really bright and it was really warm outside, and it was beautiful.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow often would you see your grandfather?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t see him, like, every single weekend, but, like, we\u2019d see him a lot. He\u2019d, like, come to my school and he\u2019d sit in the lunchroom with me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. He would just show up? Did he announce himself? Was it unexpected?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHe would never tell me that he was coming. And he\u2019d just be waiting for me right next to the lunchroom door, just waiting for me. And then I\u2019d just look around for him every time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHe\u2019d sit right next to me. And I\u2019d have my lunchbox and he\u2019d kind of just pick out things from it. Sometimes, he\u2019d take my chips, and I\u2019d be like, Papa! He\u2019d talk to my friends. He\u2019d talk about, like, all these fun things, like all his stories about, like, going to Tanzania and all sorts of things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what would you think when you saw him?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, I think \u2014 I\u2019d be proud. I\u2019d be proud that my grandpa comes to my school a lot to just eat lunch with me and tell my friends all these stories.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHe was just there right when I needed it, which made me feel really nice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t know a lot of grandpas or grandmas who\u2019d do that. That\u2019s really special.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want you to tell me, if you\u2019re willing, the story of the last few weeks and what happened with your grandfather.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you think we should start.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUh, I think we should, like, start from the beginning. Um, so papa and my grandma went to the holy lands. He wanted to take his church group there.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo they went to the Middle East?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, where baby Jesus was born and like that\u2019s sort of the place. And then they got this warning there, an outbreak has started here of the coronavirus. And so when they came back, they were straight into quarantine. But right when they came back, papa started getting really ill. He had high fever, a really high fever. And in my mind, the first week he was home, I was like, Oh, he\u2019s fine. He\u2019ll get through this. He\u2019s strong. But then he got worse and worse. And I was like, Oh, no, it\u2019s going to happen. I was just kind of in a worried state, but like not like a oh, my gosh, I\u2019m really, really sad, that sort of thing, until a couple weeks later. He just couldn\u2019t do it and he got lifted to the hospital here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Tilly, were you talking to him during this time?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t get to talk to him at all. I mean, we sent him, like, letters, but I don\u2019t know if he even got to read those. I remember \u2014 so when I heard about that he was put in the hospital \u2018cause it got worse, mom was like, do you want to sleep with one of his shirts? I was like, yeah. So she brought me this shirt. It was just like a greenish-brown T-shirt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWere you wearing it or was it just beside you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI was wearing it. It felt really, really big on me. Um, it was kind of like cold, but it felt really soothing to wear it though. I wanted to feel like I was close to him, I was giving him a hug. And I thought about him the whole night. I prayed that he would make it through, that he wouldn\u2019t have to go. But my prayer really didn\u2019t come true because he had a stroke during the night from a heart disease that he had.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nAnd that made it super worse. Even if we did get him back, he wouldn\u2019t actually, like, his body would be there, but he wouldn\u2019t be there. He couldn\u2019t do anything, like he couldn\u2019t talk \u2014 he couldn\u2019t do the things that made him him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. And how did you learn the news?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nMom got a call, and then I looked at her and I saw worry. So I kind of just did stuff. And then mommy told me what happened.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did she tell you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nShe told me about the living will that my grandma, my dad, and my uncles read it \u2014 well, the doctor read it to them \u2014 that it said that if something happened, he wanted to go. He didn\u2019t want to, like, have to suffer in this state.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo your grandfather had written a will that made clear that if he got very sick and he\u2019d reached a condition where things weren\u2019t working out, that he wanted to be allowed to die?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. And he just wanted to go to heaven and be with God. Like he says, he wanted to fall in the arms of God.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s what he wrote?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, he wants to fall in the arms of God. He was like, It\u2019s like a trust fall, really. And I couldn\u2019t handle knowing that. I knew that he wouldn\u2019t be coming back, he wouldn\u2019t be with me anymore. And that was hard to know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. How are you holding up over there?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUmm. I\u2019m OK. Um, it\u2019s hard talking about it, but it also makes me happy to talk about how great he was and what happened.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve lost my grandparents too. It\u2019s one of the kind of sad, inevitable things that it means to be alive is that the people before you die and it\u2019s just really hard.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. It is really hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI want you to know you are being very brave in telling the story. I know how difficult it must be.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Can I ask you to describe sadness to me?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat that feels like?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI feel like it\u2019s hard. Sadness is probably like a hard one for me. Happiness, I could do easily, but like sadness is kind of hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy is happiness easy and why is sadness hard do you think?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, I don\u2019t know. I mean, sadness is an emotion that is kind of like more, like, deeper and it\u2019s kind of like a big, big emotion. And happiness can be big, but not as much as sadness.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm, there\u2019s a depth to it that makes it hard to describe.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. I kind of feel like sadness is like just an ocean filled with nothing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you noticed that the people around you, your parents, that they are sad too?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. So my dad will go outside a lot. You can tell that he\u2019s getting angry and he\u2019s really short tempered. At that point, mom will kind of just stay in her office not really doing anything, but she\u2019ll just sit around. Like I\u2019ve seen mom try to keep crying to herself, and dad too, but I can see it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou mean they\u2019re trying to shield it from you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. But I can still feel it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you wish that they would just do it in front of you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why do you think they should do it more out in the open?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI would feel like it helps me understand my emotions, as well like how they feel, do I feel that?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt kind of gives you permission to feel the way you feel.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. Like when I was talking to my dad about papa, he started crying, and then I started crying, and then we just hugged and it was nice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. You know, a lot of kids are going through what you\u2019re going through right now because of this virus. And a lot of adults are going through this. I wonder how that makes you feel.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt makes me feel like I\u2019m not alone. And it also kind of makes me feel a bit angry about how they still haven\u2019t figured out how this started. I want to know, so I could figure out, like, how it wouldn\u2019t happen again. Like was it a cause of a human that did it? Was it a cause of an animal? Was it kind of both?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd if it turns out this is just something that nature and the universe gave us and it wasn\u2019t somebody who did something, how would you feel about that?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI\u2019d be mad at the universe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. I know that a lot of people, when someone they care about or they love passes away, they end up looking for that person in the world or they end up thinking about that person unexpectedly.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. They\u2019re thinking that maybe they\u2019re there or standing by you \u2014 that sort of thing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah I feel like papa was, like, by me a lot. But sometimes I feel like he\u2019s out there, like, with other people and helping them through their bad moments.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, I have a very specific sense of my grandmother whenever this song comes on because when I was around your age, she died. And a song was playing on the radio, and it was a song that made me feel sad, even though it was a love song. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard this song. It\u2019s by Richard Marx, and it goes, \u201cWherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right there waiting for you.\u201d And it always makes me think of my grandmother and her death whenever it comes on. And I wonder if you\u2019re having moments like that yet.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, I do have those type of moments, but, like, kind of different than just a song. It\u2019s more of when I saw my grandma in her backyard, because we went over just to the backyard. We weren\u2019t allowed to get close to anyone though. I felt like he \u2014 I felt, like, sad, but I also felt kind of relieved that he is in peace now. He didn\u2019t have to deal with this bad virus. He doesn\u2019t have to feel pain, or sadness, or anything.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Tilly, have you gone outside and looked up at the stars since your grandfather died?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, only a little bit, but not much. It\u2019s not the same without being at my grandma\u2019s house.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Do you think that you will do that? Do you think there\u2019ll be a point when you\u2019ll want to do that?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. We said when we\u2019re going to go over to grandma\u2019s house, me, daddy, and my big sister are gonna go walk onto the roof and just sit there looking at the stars.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Tilly, I really want to thank you for spending time with us. And I want to tell you how sorry I am about the loss of your grandfather.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt was really good to talk to you.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. It feels good to talk to someone about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s good to talk.\n\n[music]\n\nAfter this episode aired, Tilly began receiving letters from people across the country. Some knew her grandfather and wanted to share stories of their time with him. Others wanted to tell her about their own treasured relationship with a grandparent. One listener, Lee Goldman, wrote, quote, \u201cFor those lucky people like you and me, we were blessed with enough time to know our grandparents and for them to have an impact on us that will never go away.\u201d Tilly says it\u2019s been a while since her grandfather has appeared in her dreams, and that she\u2019s recently stopped wearing his shirt when she goes to bed. Tilly is spending her summer playing with her cousins and visiting places she used to go with her grandfather, like the nature center near his house. She\u2019s also been running through sprinklers, going to the pool and playing lots of Minecraft with her friends. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Thursday, the U.S. and Canada said that Russian hackers are trying to steal coronavirus vaccine research from Western health organizations. The National Security Agency said that a hacking group associated with Russian intelligence is behind the attacks, which have employed phishing and malware scams. The hacking group, known as Cozy Bear, is well known to the U.S. because it was implicated in the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee. And requirements to wear masks from state governments and private industry are spreading across the country.\n\narchived recording (jared polis) The bottom line is that, like all Coloradans, I want to be able to enjoy life and go to a restaurant and get a haircut and keep our businesses open and protect our economy and protect lives. And the data increasingly shows that one of the powerful tools that we as a state have done well on, but can do better on, is wearing masks. And that\u2019s why today I\u2019m signing an executive order that\u2019s effective at midnight tonight that requires every Coloradan age 10 and up wear a mask or face covering.\n\nmichael barbaro", "michael barbaro\n\nHey. It\u2019s Michael. This week, we\u2019re revisiting people we met in the early weeks of the pandemic, listening back and hearing what\u2019s happened to them since our original conversations. Today: Jasmine Lombrage, a restaurant owner in Baton Rouge. It\u2019s Thursday, July 16.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d When Louisiana\u2019s stay at home order expires today, restaurants across the state can begin allowing customers back inside at their own discretion. That decision now lies with restaurant owners, like Jasmine Lombrage. It\u2019s Friday, May 15.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHello?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHi, how are you?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, good. You sound great right now.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWonderful, wonderful. Hi. I\u2019m Jasmine Lombrage.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi, Jasmine. I\u2019m Michael Barbaro.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHi, nice \u2014 nice to meet you this way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nVery nice to meet you this way. Where exactly am I reaching you?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI am at the Bullfish Bar Plus Kitchen here in Baton Rouge, La.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s your restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo how long have you lived in Baton Rouge?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nMe, personally, about 17 years. My husband has been here over 20 years. And we have two girls, two beautiful girls, Gaby \u2014 she\u2019s turning 11 next month \u2014 and we have our gorgeous Angelle. She\u2019s nine.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow did you and your husband meet?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[LAUGHS] It\u2019s an old love story. We met at school. I was in dental hygiene school, and he was in culinary school. And he was working at that cafeteria. My friends said that they have good food over there, and they wanted to go. And so we went over there, and he was a quiet guy in the corner doing his own thing. I said, excuse me, what do you have here that is good and healthy that I can eat? And he looks up, and he said, Nothing is good enough for you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, jeez.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd then I turned to walk away, and he said, But if you come back tomorrow, I\u2019ll make something for you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd I just kind of smiled and said, No, thank you. And I had a few friends who are like, Yes, we\u2019re coming back tomorrow. So the next day, he made something for me. He made stir fry, and my friends \u2014 I had one of my crazy friends. She said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m not going to eat. I don\u2019t know if this guy is some kind of psycho or crazy and he\u2019s going to put something in my food. She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to eat. If nothing happens to me in a few minutes, then you \u2014 you can try it.\u201d So that\u2019s what happened. And he came back and asked, how was everything? I said, it was good. And then we started talking. Then \u2014 no then he said I\u2019m going to be his wife, and I said, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not going to happen. You know, and he said, well, he\u2019s a praying man. He always gets his heart desire.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, 10 years later, we ended up married.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you \u2014 when you two met, you were a dental hygienist student. He was training to be a chef.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how did you end up in the food industry?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, growing up, my mom always cooked, you know, for many people. So it was always a passion. I grew up cooking also with mom and just family and aunts. We just \u2014 that was just something we did. And then Angel, my husband, Chef Angel, my husband, you know, we \u2014 he was the executive corporate chef that started Voodoo BBQ & Grill, which is a restaurant here in the South. And he was known as the Pitmaster. And so what we did, we started Jazz City then, Jazz City was a catering company. And we were \u2014 he was like, well, this is what I love to do. And we wanted to do something \u2014 we have two young kids. We know that, you know, you can work hard for anyone and everyone, but really, if you want to leave that \u2014 create something for your family, you need to create something so that it can stay down and passed down for generations and generations and possibly grow. And that is our goal is to have it grow and flourish. And we ended up here at the Bullfish, and Bullfish was already \u2014 it was a restaurant previously owned by someone else. And when we came here, we made it our own by bringing new menu items. And this is the only place you can come in Louisiana and find an authentic Caribbean and Southern fusion cuisine. What he\u2019s done, what Chef has mastered, he\u2019s taken the fresh herbs that we have in the Caribbean, and then he\u2019s merged it with the wonderful spices that we have here in Louisiana. And he \u2014 there\u2019s a fusion of jerk, fish, and Southern barbecue shrimp.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. And the paella \u2014 you know, Chef makes a paella with \u2014 you know, he uses scallops. And the crawfish, which is from Louisiana, he infuses that with the andouille sausage, and then he puts the shrimp in there and the crab meat. And so it\u2019s just the different twist that he puts on all of the dishes. It\u2019s just magic in your mouth.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if you heard the music in the background a little. We kind of use a lot of Caribbean kind of music from different parts of the Caribbean, and we play different music from here. The vibe is just so, I don\u2019t need a passport, but I can get away here. Does that makes sense?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. It\u2019s funny you keep calling your husband \u201cchef.\u201d Is that how you refer to him?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAt work, we keep it professional. At home, well, when we get in a car, it\u2019s \u201choney.\u201d But when we\u2019re at work, we refer to each other \u2014 I refer to him as Chef, and he would just say whatever he had to say to me or, OK, yes, ma\u2019am, and that would be it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when did you take over the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThat was last year, 2019, May 22, 2019.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So just about \u2014 just about a year ago.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. And this restaurant, the Bullfish, it is personal for us, because our home is connected to the Bullfish.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. So that\u2019s why this pandemic \u2014 I personally have spent many nights not sleeping, because I know our home is connected to it. It\u2019s not like we have 5, 6, 7, 20 locations. This is all we have. In our home, we have two kids. My daughter, my oldest, Gaby, she\u2019s autistic. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but for now, she\u2019s depending on us to care for her. So as she grows, the home is \u2014 before we committed our home to the Bullfish \u2014 was part of the security blanket that we had. In the event something happened, she would have that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTell me what you mean when you say that your home is connected to Bullfish. You mean physically or emotionally or what?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, whenever you get a loan, you have to give some kind of guarantee, like a personal guarantee. And that\u2019s what we did, you know. We took that leap of faith and decided that we were going to put 100 percent in here to make it work. So we have to make the Bullfish work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if something were to happen to the restaurant, it would mean potentially losing your home?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd it sounds like that house is something you plan on passing on to your daughter, who\u2019s autistic.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, well, both of our girls, but we know her, at least, we can have somewhere for her in case she needed somewhere to be, and then we can have that there for her. That is something that always gets me emotional talking about, because \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[CRYING] I\u2019m sorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI understand.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nIt\u2019s \u2014 you know, and she\u2019s standing in front of me looking at me now. And we want to do whatever it takes to make it work. You know, we just have to make it work. So when this pandemic started, it really gave us a scare, because if we\u2019re not able to pay for everything, and we default on our loan, well, we understood the consequences, you know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWas there a moment when you felt that you had really kind of made it with this place, having bought it and started to make it your own?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. About a month before the pandemic, we were like, yeah, this was a good choice. My husband and I, we usually go to early morning service for church, and afterwards, we came here for brunch. And then before we were open, we had people waiting outside for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nIt was wonderful. And we were like, OK, wow, this is really going to work. This is really working. And wow, honey, this is our baby, and we\u2019re going to grow it, and we\u2019re going to be able to pay up the loan, and we\u2019re going to be able to just blow this thing out of the park. And then the pandemic started. And yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen did you first start to notice that the pandemic was impacting the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, early March \u2014 early March, because it was February was good with Valentine\u2019s Day. Early March is when everything started changing, and as March went on, the governor shut down the state. This is when, you know, you started losing staff members saying they\u2019re not coming out. I mean, you cannot blame them. We also started doing curbside delivery, and we were doing social media posts and putting up signs, handwritten signs offering discounts, letting people know that curbside pickup is available, just getting different yard signs made.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you have to put up signs in the windows or outside telling people, we\u2019re still around, you just need to call in.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, yes, yes. And then about maybe the second week after the state was closed, we would be lucky if we got two people that would call for curbside pickup. And we would just be sitting here the entire day, 11 to 8, and there\u2019s no one that would come by or no one that would call. So then I started calling the restaurant phone a couple of times to make sure the phone was working, because it never rang. We were there for hours.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you called the restaurant\u2019s main number with your cell phone just to see if it was working.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. [LAUGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAnd, you know, I started reaching out to third party \u2014 third party delivery providers to see if I can sign up with them, like Uber Eats and Waitr and DoorDash and ChowNow. And they\u2019re charging \u2014 some of them are charging from 25 percent to 35 percent.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPer order?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYeah, that\u2019s your food costs. Yes. You know, in addition to that, we\u2019re not able to buy in bulk anymore, because we\u2019ve wasted so much food. We\u2019ve thrown away so much stuff, so now we\u2019re having to go ourselves, Chef and I, to different mom and pop stores that are open, and we\u2019re having to purchase items. Of course, now you\u2019re paying more money for them, because you\u2019re not buying the same quantity anymore, and you\u2019re buying from a local retailer. So, you know, and then we have a bar here, and we weren\u2019t \u2014 no one was coming out to drink anymore, so that went away. So yeah, the pandemic, you know, it\u2019s been hard on us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. I\u2019m so sorry.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo with these delivery apps, these new sources of orders, how much money do you make off of any individual customer percentage-wise?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nRight now, you don\u2019t, because the fact that we\u2019re buying things from not just local distributors but smaller volume \u2014 we\u2019re buying things in smaller volume, so our profit margin is smaller. So we\u2019re basically not making anything. You\u2019re keeping the doors open, but you\u2019re not making anything from it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give us a sense of where your daughters have been throughout this period? At what point was their schooling interrupted?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nMaybe March. Angelle, when did school close? March or April?\n\nangelle lombrage\n\n[FAINT] It closed in March.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, school closed in March.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI used to bring my \u2014 I still do bring my two girls, so I can homeschool them, because school \u2014 they are out of school. So I use a corner of the restaurant, and I do schooling there for my girls. But it was a challenge. The change was not welcomed and open for the girls, especially my oldest, Gaby.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYou know, with autism, everything has to be \u2014 you need to have something \u2014 everything scheduled and everything has a plan you need to follow through. And this whole pandemic kind of just went haywire for her in the beginning. She was not sleeping. She was more agitated. And my youngest, Angelle, she kept saying she wanted to go back to school, so I had to find other ways to help them. So \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Jasmine, I think I hear your daughters in the background. Is that right?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, you do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you think there was a point where your daughters picked up on what has been happening for you and your husband, but beyond the stresses that they\u2019re experiencing, you know, from not being at school and social distancing, that they understood that you and your husband are struggling with this business and struggling financially?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI think so. There is one incident. My daughter, my youngest, she \u2014 you know, she gets allowance, and someone gives her money or whatever. And she saved the money, and one day, she wrote a note. And then she left a note on the bed, on my bed. I was taking a bath, and I came out, and she had a note saying that, Mom, I know you and Dad are working really hard, and things are really tough. I have some money saved. I hope this helps for you to pay for stuff.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, wow.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. That was hard. That was hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow old is this daughter who left you \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nAngelle was 8 when she did that. She just turned 9 in April. So she had a pandemic birthday.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan I ask how much she gave you?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI think it was like $57 she had.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. And what did you do with it?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI still have it saved. I still have it there. I try not to use it. It was just such a touching moment, and just to see, you know, that they realize, kids realize more than you let them know. And knowing that they\u2019re here like almost every single day with me, and \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThey see everything.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow bad are things, financially speaking, right now?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nNot close at all to where we want to be. Not good at all. Not good at all. We have applied for a lot of, you know, small business loans, and we\u2019re just waiting to hear back.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you been able to cover all the payments that you owe to the bank?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI haven\u2019t. I think finance is one of the things people don\u2019t like to talk about, but I haven\u2019t been able to meet a lot of \u2014 I had to ask for abatements. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I mean, do you think there is a situation that you could imagine using that money from your youngest daughter, that $57?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI don\u2019t want to \u2014 I don\u2019t want to, because it\u2019s hers. Even though she gave it to me, it\u2019s hers. I do not want \u2014 I don\u2019t want to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI \u2014 I\u2019m just afraid to \u2014 I\u2019m just afraid to even think about a situation like that.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Jasmine, for listeners who don\u2019t know what the rules are in Louisiana, what was announced earlier this week?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, restaurants \u2014 commencing Friday, you can, restaurants can be open for 25 percent of the capacity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you can seat up to 25 percent of what would normally fit inside the restaurant. So how many people do you think that is?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nWell, we can seat about 90 people comfortably in here. And so about 25 percent of that now is what we\u2019re allowed to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if you can only put, you know, 20 or so people inside, can you make money?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to happen, to be honest with you, because 20 percent \u2014 having 20 percent of people inside the business is not enough to sustain, and I don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to go on for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSo [SIGHS] it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a hard thing to digest right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut you have decided that you\u2019re going to let people back inside?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHonestly, me, personally, no. So it is still an open debate. We \u2014 actually, after I\u2019m done with this interview, we\u2019re going to sit down and weigh our options, the pros and the cons, and see if it\u2019s something that we want to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan I ask you what you see as the cons and the pros?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYeah, the pros \u2014 that, you know, we\u2019ll have 25 percent more revenue than what we\u2019re seeing now. And then the cons is knowing that someone will \u2014 I\u2019m afraid that, oh, my god, somebody\u2019s going to come out, and they\u2019re a carrier of Covid-19, and they infect somebody else. So I have no way of controlling that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you heard from customers about their opinions on whether it\u2019s time to go back inside the restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, I have. I\u2019ve had mixed reviews. We tend to ask customers, whenever they\u2019re picking up or, are they ready for everything to open back up. That\u2019s normally the question we would ask. And I feel that I\u2019m getting more nos than yes, though, in my opinion.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThose who have told you, Jasmine, that they do want to come out, what did they say is their reason for wanting to come out, to come back and eat in a restaurant?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThey want to get out of the house. You know, sometimes it\u2019s just the fact that you cannot do something makes you want to do it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] Yes. Yes, the forbidden fruit. Yes.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. My point, that\u2019s exactly. Like, oh, you tell me I cannot eat this? OK, I\u2019m going to. So yes, that\u2019s what I feel I\u2019m getting.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, for you, if you didn\u2019t run a restaurant, would you go out and eat right now? Would you walk into a restaurant, sit down, order food?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI would probably go out on a weekday, because weekdays are usually less busy, because I have a child that has a compromised immune system. So I\u2019m usually very careful to go out. I don\u2019t want to take something home to her, so that would be another reason that I personally will not go out. And if I did go out, minus my daughter\u2019s situation, I would have definitely found the seat \u2014 ask to be seated in the area that is far away from everybody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean it\u2019s interesting to hear you say that, that you wouldn\u2019t want to go to a restaurant unless it was specifically at a slow time because of the health of your daughter, because you\u2019re talking about yourself reopening a restaurant. So it\u2019s quite a weird conundrum.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, but it\u2019s honest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI just want to make sure I understand which of your daughters is immunocompromised.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nGaby is.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that the daughter who is autistic?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, because she was a former premature baby. I ruptured at 14 weeks when I was pregnant with her, and she had a lot of health challenges. They said, you know, that Gaby would never walk, talk, see, or hear. She was not via \u2014 she does not have any viability of life, and that she would never make it out of the hospital alive, you know. We were told that we were making a mistake for her. She coded, and it was even pronounced, and she came back. And she had a trach before, and she was on a ventilator before. She was on oxygen for the first \u2014 almost the first four years of her life. You know, she started talking late, walking late, and she had to do therapy, and, you know, she had a walker. So she had a lot of challenges to see where she is now and where she came from. So I\u2019m always careful, you know. A typical cold for you and I is just a cold, but for her, it can lead to pneumonia, or we\u2019ve lost her. We\u2019ve had her stop breathing a couple times, and nothing \u2014 I don\u2019t even know how to explain that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm. Given your daughter\u2019s health, are you worried that you\u2019re going to basically be in the kind of situation it sounds like you\u2019re afraid of kind of all the time, because people are going to be coming into your restaurant, and they could potentially get you sick, and you could potentially get your daughter sick?\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. You know, I don\u2019t know what I would do if I find myself bringing something to my child. So I find myself in a very difficult position as a business owner.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat would be very hard to live with. I understand.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThat would \u2014 yes. You know \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, it sounds \u2014 it sounds like that \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 that has to \u2014 that has to be weighing on you as you\u2019re making this decision.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, it is. It is. It is. This is personal. This is not like, oh, OK, well, I\u2019m just going to open and make the money. It\u2019s not that situation for me. I have to be careful for it. I am responsible for her, and I\u2019m also responsible for my customers, making sure they have the best experience. And I\u2019m also responsible for my team that are coming to work. So \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd you\u2019re also responsible for that house \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 that is connected to this \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nRight!\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 restaurant.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSo my hands are tied. Like, yes. It \u2014 yes, I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m just in a bind. Yeah, I\u2019m just in a bind right now. And say hi, Gaby.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSay hi. It\u2019s OK.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, I want to see you on the video. Nice to meet you, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nCan you see her? I don\u2019t know how this works.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm. I can see her. Yeah, she\u2019s got a great \u2014 she\u2019s got a leopard patterned sweater on.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. Are you going to talk?\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi. Gaby is waving.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI\u2019m doing well. Your mom was just telling us about you. She \u2014 she loves you.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes. [LAUGHS] Yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe loves you \u2014 she loves you very much.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI do. I love you, Gab.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nI love you, too.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, that was \u2014 that was a nice gift.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nYes, she walked up, so. [SIGH] I\u2019m sorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah, just give me a sec. Oof.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNo, I \u2014\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nHence the reason why I\u2019m torn up. For someone that was 1 pound, 3 ounces when she was born, she is like \u2014 she\u2019s like \u2014 I mean she\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s doing so well. And then this is so scary.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThis is so scary, you know. And then it\u2019s a hard decision. I \u2014 we don\u2019t open up, then to get customers to come in, we\u2019re putting our house more at risk. We open up, and then something happens, then I\u2019m putting my child\u2019s life at risk. I don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to be me right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYep. I\u2019m going to be really eager \u2014 we\u2019re all going to be very eager to understand what decision you make. And I want you to know that we really enjoyed getting to know you and talking to you, and we\u2019re rooting for you and for your family.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you, and please give our best to your husband and to the rest of your family.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nThank you.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nBye.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nGaby says bye.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBye, Gaby.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nSay bye.\n\ngaby lombrage\n\nBye.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\nOK, thank you, guys.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBye.\n\n[music]\n\nHours after we spoke with Jasmine, she, her husband and their staff decided that they would reopen the restaurant for indoor dining. They then quickly changed their mind, delaying that service because of health concerns. Since then, infections have surged across Louisiana, more than doubling. As a result, the state has required that everyone over eight years old wear a mask or face covering when in public, closed all bars and capped indoor dining at 50 percent capacity. The Bullfish Bar and Kitchen, however, is still not open for indoor dining, but has continued outdoor service and takeout. After the episode aired, \u201cDaily\u201d listeners began reaching out to Jasmine with offers of financial support, with prayers and with food orders.\n\njasmine lombrage\n\n(CRYING) I mean, the amount of calls. I would never forget the people that called from all over the world just to let us know that they\u2019re praying for us, they\u2019re with us and they\u2019re supporting us. And I\u2019m just so happy that mankind is \u2014 just so many good people in this world. I\u2019m just thankful. And I pray that the numbers decrease if we do our part as human beings to protect ourselves and protect each other so we can nip this virus in the bud, really. And bad things are happening. And I have no control over that. You have no control over that. But we have control of what we do, each person individually. And just showing me and my family and others that difficult does not mean impossible. You can\u2019t imagine how grateful and thankful I am. I\u2019m just \u2014 oh, my god. My family, we\u2019re so thankful.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJasmine\u2019s daughter Gaby turned 11 a few weeks ago, an event that the family celebrated with a socially distant party using Zoom. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that coronavirus infections are now increasing in 41 different states and that conditions nationwide are beginning to resemble the darkest days of the pandemic back in March. On Tuesday, California and Texas set new daily records with more than 10,000 new infections each. In both Texas and Florida, more than 130 people died, a record for both. And in Oklahoma on Wednesday \u2014\n\nkevin stitt It just kind of feels achy, like maybe the start of a little cold is what it feels like right now. But really, I feel fine.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe governor, Kevin Stitt, said that he had tested positive for the virus, becoming the nation\u2019s first governor to disclose an infection.\n\nkevin stitt So you just never know where it is. It\u2019s a virus that\u2019s in the United States. It\u2019s in Oklahoma. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s the new normal.\n\nmichael barbaro", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cReopening Schools Will Be a Huge Job\u201d (editorial, July 11):\n\nI graduated from high school a month ago. I know that distance learning is ineffective and bolsters inequalities. I want more than anything for kids to be able to return to school in the fall. However, this editorial doesn\u2019t adequately account for the realities of how schools actually function and the concerns teachers have for their safety.\n\nYou say that schools need more space. At my high school of 3,000 students, you can\u2019t just create space. The classrooms are small, the hallways are skinny and the bathrooms are cramped. The gyms and outdoor areas are already used for physical education classes.\n\nEven if you separate students during school, no one will be forcing them to separate outside school hours. This puts school staff at risk. It\u2019s not fair to ask teachers to place their lives on the line in order to fast-track a return to normalcy.\n\nI understand that keeping schools closed hurts kids and working parents, but many schools were closed when there were fewer than 10,000 U.S. cases. Does it really make sense to open them now that there are more than 3.5 million?"], "20200717": ["michael barbaro\n\nHey, there. It\u2019s Michael.

It looks like a blanket or a stuffed animal.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt\u2019s a blanket.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, what does it say on it?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt says powered by pizza.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd does it look like it has an image of pepperoni pizza on it? Is that I\u2019m glimpsing?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, pepperoni.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s pretty great. Well, Tilly, I really want to thank you for getting on the phone with us, or I guess this Google Hangout with us. And I wonder if you could tell me your full name and how old you are?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nMatilda Rose Breimhorst, and then I am 12.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. And I just want to start with a very simple question: How have you been feeling this past week?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, I\u2019m kind of in and out of moods usually. The two moods that I\u2019m mostly in are sad and angry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why do you think that you\u2019re sad and angry? What about?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI don\u2019t know we\u2019re \u2014 I feel like we\u2019re sad and angry because I think angry more that it\u2019s not fair that he\u2019s gone. And I feel like sad is really we\u2019re sad that he\u2019s gone and sad that we\u2019re being sad.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d More than 50,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus. One of them was Craig Breimhorst. Today, his granddaughter remembers him. It\u2019s Friday, May 1. I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about your grandfather. How would you describe your grandfather physically? What did he look like? What would he wear, those kind of things?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, well, he\u2019d wear pastor clothes and stuff.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWas he a pastor?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYes, he was a pastor. He used to be a mail man, and then he didn\u2019t like that job.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nAnd he had white hair, and then the mustache that goes right into the beard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nAnd when I was little, I played with his beard because it just felt so interesting touching it with my hands.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt felt all rough and scrapey, but like not too scrapey. He\u2019d wear glasses, and sometimes I stole his glasses. And he was like, Tilly, bring them back! And, like, whenever I walked into the house, he\u2019d just be like, Hoddy ho! I don\u2019t know where that came from, but it was just it\u2019s always something he said.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHoddy ho?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHoddy ho.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s more interesting than hello.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDid he have any kind of nickname for you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nTilly B was my one.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTilly B?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, \u2018cause for Breimhorst. They just called me Tilly B and and it kind of just rhymes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWait, what part? Which part rhymes?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nTilly, and then B. It\u2019s just kind of, like, it just goes together.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nTilly B.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTilly B.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. And then he\u2019d always make me happy. I\u2019d never, like, really get upset around him, unless I was hurt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nUnless you were hurt, you said.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, because we did all sorts of crazy things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWait, now, I need to understand some of the crazy things you did with him.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, well, he\u2019d take me out on the roof. Once we brought sleeping bags on the roof.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe roof of your house?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nNo, my grandpa\u2019s house, but we didn\u2019t tell my dad about it until afterwards.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. It sounds like he has a slightly mischievous quality to him.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you tell me about that? What was that like?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nWell, it would usually be like the middle of summer. And we would grab the stepladder, and open the window, pull up the screen, climb up onto the edge of the roof up to our special spot. Just laid there on the roof. And we just looked at the stars and talked for a while.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat kinds of things would your grandfather say?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, Here, Tilly, let\u2019s look for the Big Dipper, maybe the Milky Way if we\u2019re lucky, and Mars. I might be like, Wait, but isn\u2019t Mars a planet, not a star? He would just be like, But we can see it as a red star kind of.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nThe stars were really bright and it was really warm outside, and it was beautiful.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow often would you see your grandfather?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t see him, like, every single weekend, but, like, we\u2019d see him a lot. He\u2019d, like, come to my school and he\u2019d sit in the lunchroom with me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. He would just show up? Did he announce himself? Was it unexpected?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHe would never tell me that he was coming. And he\u2019d just be waiting for me right next to the lunchroom door, just waiting for me. And then I\u2019d just look around for him every time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHe\u2019d sit right next to me. And I\u2019d have my lunchbox and he\u2019d kind of just pick out things from it. Sometimes, he\u2019d take my chips, and I\u2019d be like, Papa! He\u2019d talk to my friends. He\u2019d talk about, like, all these fun things, like all his stories about, like, going to Tanzania and all sorts of things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what would you think when you saw him?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, I think \u2014 I\u2019d be proud. I\u2019d be proud that my grandpa comes to my school a lot to just eat lunch with me and tell my friends all these stories.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nHe was just there right when I needed it, which made me feel really nice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t know a lot of grandpas or grandmas who\u2019d do that. That\u2019s really special.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want you to tell me, if you\u2019re willing, the story of the last few weeks and what happened with your grandfather.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you think we should start.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUh, I think we should, like, start from the beginning. Um, so papa and my grandma went to the holy lands. He wanted to take his church group there.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo they went to the Middle East?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, where baby Jesus was born and like that\u2019s sort of the place. And then they got this warning there, an outbreak has started here of the coronavirus. And so when they came back, they were straight into quarantine. But right when they came back, papa started getting really ill. He had high fever, a really high fever. And in my mind, the first week he was home, I was like, Oh, he\u2019s fine. He\u2019ll get through this. He\u2019s strong. But then he got worse and worse. And I was like, Oh, no, it\u2019s going to happen. I was just kind of in a worried state, but like not like a oh, my gosh, I\u2019m really, really sad, that sort of thing, until a couple weeks later. He just couldn\u2019t do it and he got lifted to the hospital here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Tilly, were you talking to him during this time?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t get to talk to him at all. I mean, we sent him, like, letters, but I don\u2019t know if he even got to read those. I remember \u2014 so when I heard about that he was put in the hospital \u2018cause it got worse, mom was like, do you want to sleep with one of his shirts? I was like, yeah. So she brought me this shirt. It was just like a greenish-brown T-shirt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWere you wearing it or was it just beside you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI was wearing it. It felt really, really big on me. Um, it was kind of like cold, but it felt really soothing to wear it though. I wanted to feel like I was close to him, I was giving him a hug. And I thought about him the whole night. I prayed that he would make it through, that he wouldn\u2019t have to go. But my prayer really didn\u2019t come true because he had a stroke during the night from a heart disease that he had.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nAnd that made it super worse. Even if we did get him back, he wouldn\u2019t actually, like, his body would be there, but he wouldn\u2019t be there. He couldn\u2019t do anything, like he couldn\u2019t talk \u2014 he couldn\u2019t do the things that made him him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. And how did you learn the news?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nMom got a call, and then I looked at her and I saw worry. So I kind of just did stuff. And then mommy told me what happened.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did she tell you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nShe told me about the living will that my grandma, my dad, and my uncles read it \u2014 well, the doctor read it to them \u2014 that it said that if something happened, he wanted to go. He didn\u2019t want to, like, have to suffer in this state.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo your grandfather had written a will that made clear that if he got very sick and he\u2019d reached a condition where things weren\u2019t working out, that he wanted to be allowed to die?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. And he just wanted to go to heaven and be with God. Like he says, he wanted to fall in the arms of God.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s what he wrote?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, he wants to fall in the arms of God. He was like, It\u2019s like a trust fall, really. And I couldn\u2019t handle knowing that. I knew that he wouldn\u2019t be coming back, he wouldn\u2019t be with me anymore. And that was hard to know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. How are you holding up over there?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUmm. I\u2019m OK. Um, it\u2019s hard talking about it, but it also makes me happy to talk about how great he was and what happened.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve lost my grandparents too. It\u2019s one of the kind of sad, inevitable things that it means to be alive is that the people before you die and it\u2019s just really hard.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. It is really hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI want you to know you are being very brave in telling the story. I know how difficult it must be.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Can I ask you to describe sadness to me?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat that feels like?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI feel like it\u2019s hard. Sadness is probably like a hard one for me. Happiness, I could do easily, but like sadness is kind of hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy is happiness easy and why is sadness hard do you think?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, I don\u2019t know. I mean, sadness is an emotion that is kind of like more, like, deeper and it\u2019s kind of like a big, big emotion. And happiness can be big, but not as much as sadness.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm, there\u2019s a depth to it that makes it hard to describe.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. I kind of feel like sadness is like just an ocean filled with nothing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHave you noticed that the people around you, your parents, that they are sad too?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. So my dad will go outside a lot. You can tell that he\u2019s getting angry and he\u2019s really short tempered. At that point, mom will kind of just stay in her office not really doing anything, but she\u2019ll just sit around. Like I\u2019ve seen mom try to keep crying to herself, and dad too, but I can see it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou mean they\u2019re trying to shield it from you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. But I can still feel it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you wish that they would just do it in front of you?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why do you think they should do it more out in the open?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI would feel like it helps me understand my emotions, as well like how they feel, do I feel that?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt kind of gives you permission to feel the way you feel.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. Like when I was talking to my dad about papa, he started crying, and then I started crying, and then we just hugged and it was nice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. You know, a lot of kids are going through what you\u2019re going through right now because of this virus. And a lot of adults are going through this. I wonder how that makes you feel.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nIt makes me feel like I\u2019m not alone. And it also kind of makes me feel a bit angry about how they still haven\u2019t figured out how this started. I want to know, so I could figure out, like, how it wouldn\u2019t happen again. Like was it a cause of a human that did it? Was it a cause of an animal? Was it kind of both?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd if it turns out this is just something that nature and the universe gave us and it wasn\u2019t somebody who did something, how would you feel about that?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nI\u2019d be mad at the universe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. I know that a lot of people, when someone they care about or they love passes away, they end up looking for that person in the world or they end up thinking about that person unexpectedly.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. They\u2019re thinking that maybe they\u2019re there or standing by you \u2014 that sort of thing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah I feel like papa was, like, by me a lot. But sometimes I feel like he\u2019s out there, like, with other people and helping them through their bad moments.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, I have a very specific sense of my grandmother whenever this song comes on because when I was around your age, she died. And a song was playing on the radio, and it was a song that made me feel sad, even though it was a love song. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard this song. It\u2019s by Richard Marx, and it goes, \u201cWherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right there waiting for you.\u201d And it always makes me think of my grandmother and her death whenever it comes on. And I wonder if you\u2019re having moments like that yet.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah, I do have those type of moments, but, like, kind of different than just a song. It\u2019s more of when I saw my grandma in her backyard, because we went over just to the backyard. We weren\u2019t allowed to get close to anyone though. I felt like he \u2014 I felt, like, sad, but I also felt kind of relieved that he is in peace now. He didn\u2019t have to deal with this bad virus. He doesn\u2019t have to feel pain, or sadness, or anything.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Tilly, have you gone outside and looked up at the stars since your grandfather died?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nUm, only a little bit, but not much. It\u2019s not the same without being at my grandma\u2019s house.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Do you think that you will do that? Do you think there\u2019ll be a point when you\u2019ll want to do that?\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. We said when we\u2019re going to go over to grandma\u2019s house, me, daddy, and my big sister are gonna go walk onto the roof and just sit there looking at the stars.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Tilly, I really want to thank you for spending time with us. And I want to tell you how sorry I am about the loss of your grandfather.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt was really good to talk to you.\n\ntilly breimhorst\n\nYeah. It feels good to talk to someone about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s good to talk.\n\n[music]\n\nAfter this episode aired, Tilly began receiving letters from people across the country. Some knew her grandfather and wanted to share stories of their time with him. Others wanted to tell her about their own treasured relationship with a grandparent. One listener, Lee Goldman, wrote, quote, \u201cFor those lucky people like you and me, we were blessed with enough time to know our grandparents and for them to have an impact on us that will never go away.\u201d Tilly says it\u2019s been a while since her grandfather has appeared in her dreams, and that she\u2019s recently stopped wearing his shirt when she goes to bed. Tilly is spending her summer playing with her cousins and visiting places she used to go with her grandfather, like the nature center near his house. She\u2019s also been running through sprinklers, going to the pool and playing lots of Minecraft with her friends. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Thursday, the U.S. and Canada said that Russian hackers are trying to steal coronavirus vaccine research from Western health organizations. The National Security Agency said that a hacking group associated with Russian intelligence is behind the attacks, which have employed phishing and malware scams. The hacking group, known as Cozy Bear, is well known to the U.S. because it was implicated in the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee. And requirements to wear masks from state governments and private industry are spreading across the country.\n\narchived recording (jared polis) The bottom line is that, like all Coloradans, I want to be able to enjoy life and go to a restaurant and get a haircut and keep our businesses open and protect our economy and protect lives. And the data increasingly shows that one of the powerful tools that we as a state have done well on, but can do better on, is wearing masks. And that\u2019s why today I\u2019m signing an executive order that\u2019s effective at midnight tonight that requires every Coloradan age 10 and up wear a mask or face covering.\n\nmichael barbaro", "There are no signs to signal the way to the New Valley of Peace, or, as the Iraqis call it, the \u201cCorona cemetery.\u201d But it\u2019s not hard to find: Just follow the cars. It\u2019s the only place they are headed on the rough desert road.\n\nGround was broken on this cemetery in southern Iraq four months ago, and already there are more than 3,200 graves. The backhoes work every night to make new furrows in the sandy soil.\n\nThe story of how the cemetery came into existence starts when the first coronavirus patients began to die in March in Baghdad. The religious and health authorities were unprepared for the sense of stigma that having the disease carried, as well as the fear that touching the body would risk contagion. People whose relatives had not died of the virus felt it was a stigma to be buried next to someone who had.\n\n\u201cI began to see these scenes on TV \u2014 I still remember them \u2014 there were seven or eight bodies thrown outside a hospital morgue and they left them there,\u201d recalled Sheikh Tahir Al-Khaqani, who is head of the Imam Ali Combat Division, one of the first militias created to fight the Islamic State. Unlike some of the militias that are close to Iran, the Imam Ali brigade is linked to the moderate, inclusive senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.\n\nThe idea came to Mr. Al-Khaqani that the solution was a new graveyard just for those who died of the coronavirus. He conferred with the governor of Najaf, with Mr. Sistani and with the leader of the Shia Endowment, which is in charge of all Shiite financial and real estate matters.\n\nWithin days, they had a 1,500-acre patch of ground 20 miles from the city of Najaf, allocated for the burials.", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cReopening Schools Will Be a Huge Job\u201d (editorial, July 11):\n\nI graduated from high school a month ago. I know that distance learning is ineffective and bolsters inequalities. I want more than anything for kids to be able to return to school in the fall. However, this editorial doesn\u2019t adequately account for the realities of how schools actually function and the concerns teachers have for their safety.\n\nYou say that schools need more space. At my high school of 3,000 students, you can\u2019t just create space. The classrooms are small, the hallways are skinny and the bathrooms are cramped. The gyms and outdoor areas are already used for physical education classes.\n\nEven if you separate students during school, no one will be forcing them to separate outside school hours. This puts school staff at risk. It\u2019s not fair to ask teachers to place their lives on the line in order to fast-track a return to normalcy.\n\nI understand that keeping schools closed hurts kids and working parents, but many schools were closed when there were fewer than 10,000 U.S. cases. Does it really make sense to open them now that there are more than 3.5 million?"], "20200718": [], "20200719": [], "20200720": ["The suit, which appears to be the first of its kind across the country, sets up a confrontation between unions and politicians that could change the trajectory of school reopening over the coming weeks. In other parts of the country, including California and parts of Texas, many large school districts have concluded in recent days that it is not safe to hold in-person classes. But Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, has been pushing for things to be different in Florida, which is home to five of the country\u2019s 10 largest districts.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. DeSantis\u2019s administration ordered schools across the state to reopen five days a week starting in August. His edict came as President Trump called for schools to reopen nationwide and threatened to cut federal funding for districts that did not teach in person.\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers, the nation\u2019s second-largest teachers\u2019 union, and its local affiliate, the Florida Education Association, accused Mr. DeSantis of violating a Florida law requiring that schools be \u201csafe\u201d and \u201csecure.\u201d (An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the A.F.T. as the nation\u2019s largest union.) The unions, along with parent and teacher plaintiffs, asked a state court in Miami to block the governor\u2019s reopening order and allow local school superintendents and health departments to have full control over reopening decisions.\n\nMr. DeSantis distanced himself from the executive order on Monday, noting at a news conference that it had been issued by the state\u2019s department of education, not by him. \u201cYou know, they have a board and they do different things,\u201d he said.\n\nThe order was signed by Richard Corcoran, the state\u2019s commissioner of education, a former speaker of the Florida House who was tapped for the position by Mr. DeSantis when he was governor-elect and who was officially appointed by the board.\n\nBut Mr. DeSantis has urged schools to reopen for in-person instruction. \u201cIf fast food and Walmart and Home Depot \u2014 and I do all that so I\u2019m not, like, looking down on it \u2014 but if all that is essential, then educating our kids is absolutely essential,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said this month. \u201cAnd they have been put to the back of the line in some respects.\u201d"], "20200721": ["1978\n\nThe Gang of 19 and ADAPT\n\nOn July 5, 1978, a group of 19 people gathered at one of the busiest intersections in Denver, at Colfax Avenue and Broadway, got out of their wheelchairs and lay down to stop traffic. Their goal was to protest the inaccessibility of the city\u2019s public transit system.\n\nThe group had been pushing the city to install wheelchair lifts, and when a new fleet of buses was released without them, they were angry. The protest ultimately led to the creation of the Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (now the American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today), in 1983, which quickly expanded with chapters all around the country. The group then pushed for transportation provisions to be added to the A.D.A.\n\n1982\n\n\u2018Baby Doe\u2019 and \u2018Baby Jane Doe\u2019\n\nIn 1982, the parents of a baby with Down syndrome in Bloomington, Ind., were advised by doctors to decline surgery to treat the baby\u2019s blocked esophagus. Disability rights activists tried to intervene, but Baby Doe, as he came to be known, starved to death before legal action could be taken.\n\nDr. C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general of the United States at the time, said the boy was denied food and water not because the treatment was unreasonably risky, but because the baby was intellectually disabled, a decision he did not agree with.\n\nIn 1983, another case surfaced on Long Island that came to be known as Baby Jane Doe. The baby was born with an open spinal column; her parents opted against surgery, even though it could have prolonged her life.", "There have been similar unforced errors in messaging around outdoor transmission of the virus. Outdoor transmission is possible but much less likely, a nuance that wasn\u2019t properly communicated early on.\n\n\u201cMy perception is that public health officials were hesitant to be too vocal about the outdoors being safe,\u201d Dr. Dhillon said. This was an example, he said, of experts hedging language to make sure the public didn\u2019t over- or underreact. But it\u2019s a gamble, trying to control how others receive your message. Dr. Dhillon argued that the same thing happened with masks, where officials and institutions were hesitant to suggest them early on because of supply chain issues.

The result is one of the most emotionally draining movies in memory, the rare scary movie that evokes Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s sensitive play \u201cThe Waverly Gallery,\u201d another portrait of a family dealing with the declining mind of a matriarch suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s.", "Education officials in New York City, one of the few large districts in the country that are still planning to open schools in the fall, laid out a plan on Thursday for what would happen in the seemingly inevitable event that cases of the coronavirus are confirmed in a classroom.\n\nThe protocol means it is likely that at many of the city\u2019s 1,800 schools, individual classrooms or even entire buildings will be closed at points during the school year. Although the city\u2019s test positivity rate and caseload are relatively low, many public health experts expect those numbers to tick up this fall, whether or not schools reopen.\n\nOfficials said confirmed infections among students, teachers and staff members would be treated the same. One or two confirmed cases in a single classroom would require those classes to close for 14 days; all students and staff members in that classroom would be ordered to self-quarantine, and students would learn remotely. The rest of the school would continue to operate.\n\nBut if two or more people in different classrooms in the same school tested positive, the entire building would close while disease detectives from the city\u2019s Department of Health were brought in to investigate the cases, which could take several days. Depending on the results of the investigation, the building could reopen, but the classrooms with positive cases would remain closed for 14 days.\n\nIf disease detectives were not able to find a link between two or more confirmed cases in a building, including exposure to the virus outside of school, the entire building would remain shuttered for two weeks.\n\nNew York City is currently planning to reopen its schools on a hybrid model starting Sept. 10, with students reporting to classrooms one to three days a week to allow for social distancing. All staff members will be asked to take coronavirus tests before the start of school, with expedited results.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration faced enormous criticism for waiting until mid-March to close schools, after the virus had already begun to spread significantly throughout the city, which soon became a global center of the crisis. Throughout March, when a student or staff member tested positive, the school would automatically close for 24 hours for cleaning, a protocol that many parents and teachers said was too lax.", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cWhat Do the Kids Think?\u201d (Sunday Review, July 26), a selection of comments from students about going back to school:\n\nI am the mother of a 12-year-old girl. During this past spring and now summer I have had the opportunity to \u201clisten in\u201d on some of my daughter\u2019s FaceTime and group chats with other 12- and 13-year-old kids. I have been truly enlightened.\n\nAt first I thought they were just snarky, opinionated tweens. But I have come to realize they are bright and compassionate thinkers.\n\nAs I passed by my daughter\u2019s room one day, I overheard these various statements among her and her friends: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be made political pawns,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019re being used for the economy,\u201d \u201chow could I live with myself if I brought the virus home to my granny?,\u201d \u201clearning online isn\u2019t that hard if it saves my family and friends,\u201d \u201cwhy do we not get a voice?,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019re scared too,\u201d \u201chow can that president use us like we don\u2019t matter?,\u201d \u201cI wish I could vote,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019re not lab rats.\u201d\n\nI was awed by them. Proud. Would I have been this evolved at her age? I don\u2019t know. But what I do know, and your article confirmed it, is that kids are listening. They are learning. They are communicating. They are thinking. And they want to be heard."], "20200730": [], "20200731": []}
