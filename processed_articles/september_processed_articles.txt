That provision expired in July, though landlords could not begin eviction proceedings for 30 days.\n\nTo apply for the new moratorium, tenants will have to attest to a substantial loss of household income, the inability to pay full rent and best efforts to pay partial rent. Tenants must also stipulate that eviction would be likely to leave them homeless or force them to live with others at close quarters. Forms will be available on the C.D.C. website once the order is published in the Federal Register.\n\nThe order provides for criminal penalties for violations, but it does not relieve tenants of their ultimate obligation to pay rent. It applies to those who expect to earn no more than $99,000 this year or who meet other income limits.\n\nTenant advocacy groups have said millions could face eviction in the coming months without government intervention.\n\nThe National Multifamily Housing Council, which represents landlords, denounced the moratorium.

You might be calm as a pond under test conditions, but what about when your coach screams at you or after you get rich? There is the N.F.L.\u2019s own in-house I.Q. test, a broad, catchall exam called the Player Assessment Test, or P.A.T., which is a dubious name for a football test, considering that acronym is already taken for this sport.\n\nThe test was designed in 2013 by a psychology professor from Baruch College and a human-resources management professor from Marymount University, and now their firm, Siena Consulting, has a deal with the N.F.L. to administer it during the draft process. According to Michael Signora, the N.F.L.\u2019s senior vice president of football and international communications, every team receives the full batch of P.A.T. scores for every draft class. Whether they look at them or not is a different matter. None of the N.F.L. sources I spoke with for this article expressed any use for them. Leonard Zaichkowsky, a retired Boston University professor of sports psychology and psychometrics and co-author of \u201cThe Playmaker\u2019s Advantage: How to Raise Your Mental Game to the Next Level,\u201d says that he has been asking the N.F.L. about the P.A.T. for years without success. \u201cIt\u2019s highly guarded,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unfortunate, because there could be useful information that they\u2019re gathering.\u201d\n\nAnd then, of course, everyone takes the Wonderlic. If you follow sports, you\u2019ve heard of the Wonderlic: an intelligence test graded on a scale from 1 to 50. It was created in 1937 by a Northwestern University psychology graduate named Eldon (Al) Wonderlic and based on the brain science of 1937. Wonderlic Inc., now under the third generation of family leadership, offers a broad assortment of workplace-related diagnostics that are still widely administered across corporate America. The test that N.F.L. players take has been updated over the years, but it remains basically the same test \u2014 pencil and paper, 50 questions in 12 minutes. An entire brain reduced to a single number. You can take a version of the Wonderlic online right now. In 2016, Sports Illustrated published a sample question: \u201cAre the following two words similar, contradictory, or not related? Aghast/Unsurprised.\u201d\n\nThe N.F.L.\u2019s history with the Wonderlic began in a vegetable garden outside Chicago in 1975. The Dallas Cowboys\u2019 head coach, Tom Landry, just happened to be driving by when he spotted Wonderlic\u2019s headquarters; recognizing the name, he pulled into the parking lot. Charlie Wonderlic, who runs the company today, has no idea what Landry was doing in suburban Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s the story that\u2019s been passed down for 45 years,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the details. I just know he wasn\u2019t headed directly there.\u201d Landry was a Texas type \u2014 lean, laconic, coached games in a gray suit and a fedora \u2014 and he was already a legend by this point. So when Landry walked into the lobby and asked to speak to the man in charge, Al led him to Wonderlic\u2019s vegetable garden for a quick psychology seminar.\n\nFrom Landry and the Cowboys, the Wonderlic spread to the N.F.L. Combine. A single flat score is functionally useless for N.F.L. front offices, but for decades that one score was all they had. The scores were supposed to be confidential, but they leaked out all the time, and an unsettling pattern began to emerge: White quarterbacks drew headlines for sky-high scores, and Black quarterbacks who scored in the single digits received similar attention. Arguably the player most associated with the Wonderlic is the former University of Texas quarterback Vince Young, who reportedly scored a 6 ahead of the 2006 draft \u2014 a clear harbinger of a future N.F.L. flop, according to the Wonderlic. The Tennessee Titans still drafted him third over all, though, and he was named A.F.C. Rookie of the Year in 2006, before soon losing his place in the league. The Wonderlic is far from the only reason that the quarterback position (supposedly the \u201chardest\u201d to master) was almost exclusively white for decades or why skill positions like running back, wide receiver and cornerback (the \u201ceasiest\u201d) were even more exclusively Black. For much of the N.F.L.\u2019s recent history, though, it has supplied bigoted coaches and G.M.s all the rationale they needed to reinforce their biases."], "20200902": ["So have a look, and see if you can find a way to include any of these opportunities in your curriculum this year, whether to help students document their lives, tell stories, express opinions, investigate ideas, or analyze culture.

According to Michael Signora, the N.F.L.\u2019s senior vice president of football and international communications, every team receives the full batch of P.A.T. scores for every draft class. Whether they look at them or not is a different matter. None of the N.F.L. sources I spoke with for this article expressed any use for them. Leonard Zaichkowsky, a retired Boston University professor of sports psychology and psychometrics and co-author of \u201cThe Playmaker\u2019s Advantage: How to Raise Your Mental Game to the Next Level,\u201d says that he has been asking the N.F.L. about the P.A.T. for years without success. \u201cIt\u2019s highly guarded,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unfortunate, because there could be useful information that they\u2019re gathering.\u201d\n\nAnd then, of course, everyone takes the Wonderlic. If you follow sports, you\u2019ve heard of the Wonderlic: an intelligence test graded on a scale from 1 to 50. It was created in 1937 by a Northwestern University psychology graduate named Eldon (Al) Wonderlic and based on the brain science of 1937. Wonderlic Inc., now under the third generation of family leadership, offers a broad assortment of workplace-related diagnostics that are still widely administered across corporate America. The test that N.F.L. players take has been updated over the years, but it remains basically the same test \u2014 pencil and paper, 50 questions in 12 minutes. An entire brain reduced to a single number. You can take a version of the Wonderlic online right now. In 2016, Sports Illustrated published a sample question: \u201cAre the following two words similar, contradictory, or not related? Aghast/Unsurprised.\u201d\n\nThe N.F.L.\u2019s history with the Wonderlic began in a vegetable garden outside Chicago in 1975. The Dallas Cowboys\u2019 head coach, Tom Landry, just happened to be driving by when he spotted Wonderlic\u2019s headquarters; recognizing the name, he pulled into the parking lot. Charlie Wonderlic, who runs the company today, has no idea what Landry was doing in suburban Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s the story that\u2019s been passed down for 45 years,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the details. I just know he wasn\u2019t headed directly there.\u201d Landry was a Texas type \u2014 lean, laconic, coached games in a gray suit and a fedora \u2014 and he was already a legend by this point. So when Landry walked into the lobby and asked to speak to the man in charge, Al led him to Wonderlic\u2019s vegetable garden for a quick psychology seminar.\n\nFrom Landry and the Cowboys, the Wonderlic spread to the N.F.L. Combine. A single flat score is functionally useless for N.F.L. front offices, but for decades that one score was all they had. The scores were supposed to be confidential, but they leaked out all the time, and an unsettling pattern began to emerge: White quarterbacks drew headlines for sky-high scores, and Black quarterbacks who scored in the single digits received similar attention. Arguably the player most associated with the Wonderlic is the former University of Texas quarterback Vince Young, who reportedly scored a 6 ahead of the 2006 draft \u2014 a clear harbinger of a future N.F.L. flop, according to the Wonderlic. The Tennessee Titans still drafted him third over all, though, and he was named A.F.C. Rookie of the Year in 2006, before soon losing his place in the league. The Wonderlic is far from the only reason that the quarterback position (supposedly the \u201chardest\u201d to master) was almost exclusively white for decades or why skill positions like running back, wide receiver and cornerback (the \u201ceasiest\u201d) were even more exclusively Black. For much of the N.F.L.\u2019s recent history, though, it has supplied bigoted coaches and G.M.s all the rationale they needed to reinforce their biases.", "However, he described that as a \u201cvery, very low chance.\u201d\n\nThat message ran counter to the optimistic assertions in recent days from the White House that a vaccine could be ready for distribution before Election Day in November.

The family has talked to them, kindly, about the long-term cost of children and the importance of birth control. It falls on deaf ears. The two contact me only when they need money. They often ask other family members for money too. I live on a strict fixed income, but I don\u2019t want the children to suffer, so I\u2019ve provided occasional diapers, formula and cash.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Early in the pandemic, nursing homes, jails and meatpacking plants were the sites of coronavirus outbreaks across the country. Now, as some students have returned to campuses for the fall semester, the new hot spots are colleges and universities. My colleague, Natasha Singer, has the story of one school and one student. It\u2019s Wednesday, September 16. So Natasha, tell me how you came to find Zoie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in August, we started receiving what I would call these S.O.S. messages from students at universities. And we got these messages because we have a system called Tip Jar, where readers who want to be whistleblowers or who just have complaints or who want to give us tips about things to look into can write to us anonymously. So these messages started coming from different campuses of college students who were sequestered in these special dorms for students who test positive for coronavirus. And they were describing being kind of trapped in these filthy conditions, in quarantine dorms with, like, dead bugs and mold in the walls, and, like, leaking bathrooms. But also, they felt like they\u2019d been abandoned. That the university had sort of cut them off to keep them from being contagious and infecting anybody else and then forgotten about them.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) Good morning, TikTok. So I\u2019m quarantined in my N.Y.U. dorm room for two weeks, and I can\u2019t leave. And they bring us meals every day.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so I decided I would try to find some students who were in quarantine and isolation on college campuses.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) It\u2019s 11:15. And I just got my breakfast. So let\u2019s see what it is. Because so far the food has been questionable.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd I looked at TikTok, because we\u2019d been seeing all these videos of kids on TikTok complaining about bad meals.\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) For breakfast that was delivered at 12:30 \u2014 warm grape juice. Mystery vegan muffin. Oat bar. An unripe orange. tiktok clip (college student 2) But is anyone else who goes to the University of Michigan just, like, what the [EXPLETIVE] is happening right now? And, like, terrified \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nIn addition to that, there were these students who were complaining about more profound things.\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) I think N.Y.U. saw my TikTok last night. Because it is currently 2:00 p.m. And they have not fed me all day. tiktok clip (college student 2) We were given almost no supplies. We were given no food, no masks, no gloves, no microwave, no bed sheets, no soap, no cleaning supplies. Nothing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd while I was looking at students who were more concerned \u2014\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) N.Y.U., I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings. Please feed me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\n\u2014 I saw videos by this student at the University of Alabama.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Hey, y\u2019all. This is day one of quarantine. I found out today that I have Covid and now my university has sent me to a small apartment by myself for 14 days.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd her name is Zoie Terry. And she was just documenting her experience being isolated in this dorm by herself.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) OK. I\u2019m not going to lie. This apartment is kind of scary. But we\u2019re just going to go with it. They also gave three waters. I\u2019ll keep you all updated on how I\u2019m doing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she was upbeat. And she has this huge smile. And she\u2019s completely charming. But the conditions behind her were very bleak, it seemed. So I went to the University of Alabama directory and I looked up every student named Zoie.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then, you know, I found this Zoie. And I just sent her an email saying, you know, I\u2019d like to know what it\u2019s like. I want to know what your experience was like in that isolation dorm.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd who is Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nZoie is a sophomore at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\n\nzoie terry My name is Zoie Terry. I\u2019m 19 years old. I am from Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so last year, she joined a sorority. And she was living, you know, in a freshman dorm and looking forward to the fall. But right before spring break, the coronavirus began to spread.\n\nzoie terry And then once I went home, within the hour of being home, they emailed us and told us that we weren\u2019t coming back.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd they never came back to school. Because the coronavirus shut down the campus.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did you feel about that, when that happened? zoie terry I was very upset. Me and all my friends were kind of devastated. Because we were just getting into the hang of college life. But I kind of was more freaked out because I didn\u2019t know, like, if I need to start getting my stuff ready at home to be living at home, or anything like that. Because my mom lived in a two-bedroom apartment with my twin brother and her.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she stayed at home with her mom. And they, you know, kind of banded together to wait this out.\n\nzoie terry I convinced my mom to let me get a dog. And that was kind of all I did the entire quarantine. I just watched my dog grow up, basically.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what\u2019s the status of Zoie\u2019s sophomore year? Is the university making plans to reopen?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in June, Kay Ivey, who\u2019s the governor of Alabama, announced this incredibly ambitious program to reopen the public colleges and universities in the entire state. And she puts up federal money, $30 million from, like, federal emergency coronavirus response funds to create this program to test every single student returning to college in Alabama for coronavirus before they get to school. And that could be, you know, 150,000 students.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd how are they going to do that? We keep reading about all the shortages in testing. How are you going to test over 150,000 students?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nIt\u2019s actually a fascinating story because one of the University of Alabama schools \u2014 the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2014 is a major academic medical center and has a major medical school. The governor asked the University of Alabama at Birmingham to take on this colossal testing of every returning college student. And so they ramped up their capacity to test. And they ramped up to be able to process 10 to 12,000 student coronavirus tests a day. They also set up this kind of military level logistics, where they opened 13 coronavirus testing sites for students around the state. And students had to be tested up to two weeks before they returned to campus. And the University of Alabama president and others, as they were describing this, promised that they would be the safest campuses in America when these Alabama schools reopened.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so during the summer, while all these students are getting tested, where is Alabama in terms of infections?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo by August, when the University of Alabama was gearing up to reopen, Alabama had the seventh highest per capita infection rate in the United States.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it was a calculated risk. But they felt their program was comprehensive and that they would be able to safely reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what about Zoie? Is she feeling like this is a risk?\n\nzoie terry I guess a couple weeks before school started, I was like, I felt more comfortable with the idea of going back to school, because everybody had to get tested before they even were allowed to return on campus.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo for Zoie to go back to school, she also had to get one of these tests that every other college student in Alabama was going to take.\n\nzoie terry And it came back negative. So I was allowed to come to school.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she comes back to school early before classes start, because she is going to participate in sorority rush and help interview and identify the first-year students, the girls who are going to be part of the sorority and move into the house next year.\n\nzoie terry So coming back, it was super strange. And everything looked so different because just social distancing and everything like that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYou know, usually this is a really festive, social, in-person gathering. And now they have to do rush online. They have to interview prospective sorority members virtually. But they still are putting a huge amount of energy into this. And Zoie is staying up late. And then she\u2019s waking up really, really early to help organize the rush and interview the prospective students.\n\nzoie terry And so when you have lack of sleep, you kind of start to feel a little sick. You know what I mean? But I was thinking, there was no way I could have had the virus. Because I was following every guideline. I was doing nothing. I was in my room 24/7. And so a day or two went by, and my body just felt so weak and so feverish. And I call my mom. And she\u2019s, like, you need to go get tested, just to make sure.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she gets an appointment to be tested that day. And she goes down to student health services. And she has a coronavirus test.\n\nzoie terry And it told me that I was positive. archived recording (natasha singer) And then what did you do? zoie terry So I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do. Because it was very new. So basically, I had to contact the University of Alabama Covid-19 hotline. And, like, there\u2019s a button where it\u2019s like, if you think you may have Covid, press this. If you\u2019re calling for positive test results, press this. So then I pressed that and I was assigned a case manager. And we just \u2014 she talked to me on the phone. I was having a little bit of a meltdown. I was, like, crying and hyperventilating. And she was like, are you OK? Like, I know this is so scary. But you are going to be OK, I promise you. We\u2019re going to get through this. And I will tell you exactly what to do. And I was, like OK, like, thank you so much. And I was, like, trying to calm myself down on the other side of the line. But \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she gets this email saying to her, you\u2019re going to move to this place. And there\u2019s going to be a lockbox with your key.\n\nzoie terry So I just packed all my clothes and stuff. I packed my TV. And, like, I packed my essential oil diffuser and, like, fun things like that. And try to make it as homey as possible, because I was going to be very homesick, I knew.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she gets the key. And she goes there and she opens the door. And it\u2019s kind of empty.\n\nzoie terry When I went there, there was nobody there. None of the lights were on in the buildings. And I was the only one quarantined in my apartment. I think they were just starting to quarantine people. So everything was very fresh and new to them. And \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThere\u2019s no toilet paper. And there\u2019s no, you know, sanitizer. And there\u2019s nobody to greet her, right? There\u2019s nobody from the university. There\u2019s no nurse. There\u2019s nobody in a mask. There\u2019s no security guard. There\u2019s nobody to escort her in and tell her what\u2019s going to happen and tell her who she can call. She\u2019s basically alone to fend for herself.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did that feel, going to this place by yourself? zoie terry Well, I have a lot of anxiety. So it was an experience, me first going there. And keep in mind, I also had corona. So I was very sick and very just \u2014 my emotions were very high. So I just remember I walked in, and I went straight to the furthest room, turned the lights on, shut the door. And I just sat there and started crying. I just cried for, like, five minutes. And then I pulled myself together. And I went and got my stuff from the car.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe calls her mom, who\u2019s a former I.C.U. nurse. And she calls her sister who works in New York. And she basically FaceTimes with them. And that is the beginning of what gets her through it.\n\nzoie terry So basically, my sister took what we called the day shift. First thing I would do when I wake up is call her. So I would have her on FaceTime the entire day. And my mom took the night shifts. So my mom would be on FaceTime with me throughout the night. She likes to say she monitored my breathing just in case something happened in the middle of the night where I passed out or something like that. She wanted to have my attention 24/7, in case I was like unresponsive or something. So \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBasically you were live streaming 24/7, 12 hours a day with your sister and 12 with your mom?\n\nzoie terry Yeah. I would have panic attacks. And I would think that I was, like, I couldn\u2019t breathe. But it was actually due to my anxiety and panic attacks. So I would, like, tell my mom what I was experiencing and what was happening with my health. And then she would let me know what to do from then on.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo how sick was Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe had a fever. She was exhausted. She had some breathing issues. Some of it was anxiety. But you know, it\u2019s hard to know. And so that is one of the reasons her mother wanted to monitor her. They also had a recent family tragedy. Zoie\u2019s father had a respiratory illness and he died last year. And so the fact the coronavirus was a respiratory illness, and that Zoie had it, also heightened the anxiety for the whole family and made her mom want to monitor her and act, you know, as the guardian. Because the university is not acting as a guardian of this sick student.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWhat\u2019s happening on campus as Zoie is locked in quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she really was one of the first students to go into this quarantine dorm. But as the days go by, coronavirus is spreading across campus. And so more cars are in the parking lot. A few students begin to move in. Right? And before she\u2019s moved out, there is an outbreak on campus. Kids have been going to parties without their mask on. They\u2019ve been gathering en masse in local bars in Tuscaloosa without masks on. And there is an explosion of virus cases.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Natasha, while Zoie\u2019s been in quarantine, the virus has really been taking off across campus?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYeah. And the story of how Zoie thinks she got coronavirus is indicative of how the outbreaks are spreading on campus.\n\nzoie terry The one night I had left my sorority house and had went and, like, interacted with friends, it was me and three other girls. And we had all ordered Chipotle to her house. And we all ate dinner together. And we watched a movie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she goes to call one of the friends who was at the dinner that night.\n\nzoie terry I was very nervous to call. I said, hey girl, what are you doing? And she was, like, she sounded really upset. And she goes, I\u2019m currently getting tested for Covid. And I was, like, really? That\u2019s so funny you say that. And before I could even finish my sentence, she goes, so and so has it in my house. So if you got it from this person, then I am so sorry. And I said, no, that\u2019s totally fine. I was actually calling you to tell you that I have tested positive for Covid, and that you need to get tested. And she goes, no, yeah, I\u2019m getting tested right now. So thank you for telling me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo it turned out that all the girls who were at the dinner that evening ended up getting coronavirus. And this was before classes had even started. So you can imagine how the virus started to spread as students were returning to campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo this extensive plan that the state had for testing, what went wrong?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThey tested tens of thousands of students before they came back to campus. But there was a really weak link in this testing protocol. And that was students had to be tested within two weeks of coming back to campus. But that means, like, you could test me two weeks before I go back to campus, and then I could go to a party and get Covid.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOr I might not know I have it, right, and you test me, and it takes four days to develop. And then I\u2019m going to bring my Covid with me to campus. And so there was a huge effort to do this testing. But I interviewed an epidemiologist who said it was kind of useless to test kids even a week out. And Alabama did its best. And I asked them why they used this two-week window. And they said, look, we are testing kids at scale. It was believed to be the largest student testing program in terms of higher ed anywhere in the country. And there was no way they could have processed all those 150,000 tests only two days before classes start. So they traded off getting everybody for, you know, in fact not doing it so close to the return.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo what is the situation on campus when Zoie gets out of quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo after 10 days, Zoie is finally free.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Guess what, you guys? I am done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe makes this jailbreak TikTok.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) And you might be asking yourself, Zoie, what is the first thing you do when you\u2019re free? And to that I say, I get Dunkin\u2019 with Linda!\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then she goes home to visit her mom and her dog.\n\nzoie terry And my dog \u2014 [LAUGHS] \u2014 he didn\u2019t really recognize it was me, though. It was kind of sad. Because I had the mask on \u2014 until I started speaking in my dog voice. Everybody has one. archived recording (natasha singer) Can you use your dog voice? zoie terry Oh, no. (IN DOG VOICE) I just talk like this to my Simon. He\u2019s very cute. I just talk like this to him. archived recording (natasha singer) It sounds like your own language. zoie terry He knows, he knows \u2014 if I were to say, \u201cSimon, come here\u201d in my normal voice, he wouldn\u2019t know that I was talking to him. But if I was, like, (IN DOG VOICE) \u201cSimon, come here,\u201d then he would know I was talking to him. archived recording (natasha singer) I love that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBy the time, Zoie gets back to campus, it\u2019s a completely different place. There are even more restrictions in place to try to get a handle on this virus outbreak on campus. Students are essentially confined to their room except for essential activities. They can\u2019t have any gatherings. They can\u2019t hang out in their dorms. They can\u2019t go to common spaces. The dining hall is closed except for takeout. And the bars in Tuscaloosa are closed for two weeks.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s very strange. Honestly, it\u2019s not very fun. I could be doing a way cheaper option of doing, like, a community college online instead of paying my tuition that I\u2019m paying right now.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she basically spends a lot of time in her room. The majority of her classes are now online except for one of them. And yet, she still wants to be there.\n\nzoie terry But also, I\u2019m here for like the education and the resources they have for the major I\u2019m in.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it really matters to her.\n\nzoie terry My mom and my dad both went here. And so that\u2019s why I mainly chose to come to school here, is because I am the last child out of 5 to go to college. And the only one to go to \u2018Bama. So it was kind of a given for me to come here. natasha singer So you\u2019re like the Roll Tide legacy? zoie terry Definitely. We are a big, big, big football fan family.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe\u2019s carrying on this major family tradition that is both educational and intellectual and social. And she wants to stick it out. And they all hope the university can pull this off.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s just kind of upsetting. Because my freshman year wasn\u2019t that great. Because I was just getting over the passing of my dad, and I was dealing with grief my entire freshman year. So I was kind of looking forward to my sophomore year thinking, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s going to be so much fun. Like, I\u2019m going to meet all these new people. And now that I\u2019m here and everything\u2019s happening with Covid, we can\u2019t have the sophomore year that everybody else has been able to have in years past. And I can\u2019t even imagine how the freshmen feel. I feel so bad for them. Because they\u2019re coming to college and, like, this isn\u2019t what college is like. Like, during rush, I was telling people, I was like, I promise this isn\u2019t what college is like. It\u2019s so much more fun this. And it\u2019s going to be OK. We\u2019re going to get through this. We just have to get over this hump. And once everything\u2019s better, hopefully we get a vaccine, and maybe one day things can go back to normal. But until then, we just gotta push through this time and hope for things to get better.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what is your understanding of why states and schools like the University of Alabama pushed to do this in the first place?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nI think that there are multiple factors that affect whether universities decided to reopen or not. And there are fascinating calculations that went on about what number or percent of students are going to get the virus, and what is an acceptable risk to take. And we see that some universities, even large state universities, made the decision that they were not going to reopen for in-person instruction. They were not going to bring students back to campus. Some of them made that decision for the semester and some said, look, we\u2019re going to spend the first six weeks online and we\u2019ll see what happens. And other universities made the calculation that it would be much better to reopen. It would be better for their financial interests and financial survival. It would be better for students who would have a much better experience. There\u2019s nothing that beats in-person interaction. They were going to, you know, cause education loss and emotional kind of growth loss by not opening.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nCan you explain the financial piece of that a little bit more, the financial calculation?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nRight. Well, universities obviously need tuition money and residential hall kind of dorm occupancy money and dining hall money to keep going. And yes, state schools get state money. But they also need revenue. And so there\u2019s a large financial calculation about, you know, are we going to not reopen and lose all that income? Or are we going to open and get some of that income? And are we going to open and get some of that income, knowing we\u2019re going to close, but at least we\u2019ll have reaped some of that? So there\u2019s a big picture financial driver behind deciding to reopen or not. And then there are financial decisions every step of the way. Like, OK, we\u2019re going to reopen. Are we going to reopen at full dorm occupancy and get all that money that we need for residential life? Or are we going to take a hit and actually say only freshmen and seniors can come back? And that will allow us to have only one student per room. And that will really reduce the risk, we hope, of spread of virus. But we\u2019re going to take a financial hit. And so we see universities making different calculations. Some have decided we\u2019re not going to test kids. We\u2019re only going to test kids for the virus if they show symptoms or if they\u2019ve been exposed. We see other universities, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and they have decided they\u2019re going to test every student twice a week. This is a major state university deciding the only way they can reopen safely is to test every student two times a week, week after week. Right? That is a financial calculation. They\u2019re going to spend that money because they\u2019re trying to buy down risk. And then there\u2019s the political calculation. If you are a Republican governor in a largely Republican state, where there is a debate over whether people should be required to wear masks or not, there might be other reasons why you decide that you should reopen. Because your constituents want you to reopen and your president wants you to reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd we saw Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, say recently that it is much more risky now for universities that have reopened and have large outbreaks to send students home, where they might spread the virus, than to keep them there. And so we\u2019re seeing universities that in a sense fostered virus outbreaks by reopening have to keep the virus outbreaks under control by keeping students on campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd Natasha, your reporting on what happened to Zoie and the University of Alabama first published a few days ago. What has happened since then?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOn the same day the story came out, about eight hours later, the president of the University of Alabama sent out this message to students and faculty and staff and parents. And what he said was that they were implementing these important new changes.\n\nnatasha singer Do you know that the university sent out an email after the story came out that they\u2019re going to change quarantine and isolation? zoie terry I did not know that. natasha singer Well, I\u2019m just going to read it to you. Because I got an email from the president of U Alabama today. zoie terry OK. natasha singer I\u2019m going to read it to you. OK. So: \u201cDear students, faculty, staff and parents, hoping your Labor Day weekend was safe and relaxing. I want to update you on Covid-19 steps we have implemented effective today. \u201cFor our students who test positive and prepare to move to campus isolation spaces, staffing and medical resources have been enhanced to ensure prompt communication and expanded services.\u201d zoie terry That\u2019s amazing. Wow, OK. That makes me so happy. natasha singer Congratulations, Zoie. You\u2019ve made the University of Alabama quarantine better. zoie terry Thank you. Oh, my gosh. That\u2019s so great. Oh, that makes me feel so much better. For people I know going into quarantine, and if I have to go into quarantine again, like later on this year? Oh, that makes me feel so much better. Thank you so much. I\u2019m super happy that I had a voice in all of this. Because at the beginning when I first went into quarantine, I just sat in that room and cried because I was like, nobody\u2019s going to hear my story about this at all. Nobody is going to know about this. And now that I actually have a voice and people are going to hear about this, I\u2019m super thankful.\n\n[music]\n\nmegan twohey\n\nIn the latest reports from the University of Alabama, more than 2,500 students and nearly 1,200 faculty and staff have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past month.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Early in the pandemic, nursing homes, jails and meatpacking plants were the sites of coronavirus outbreaks across the country. Now, as some students have returned to campuses for the fall semester, the new hot spots are colleges and universities. My colleague, Natasha Singer, has the story of one school and one student. It\u2019s Wednesday, September 16. So Natasha, tell me how you came to find Zoie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in August, we started receiving what I would call these S.O.S. messages from students at universities. And we got these messages because we have a system called Tip Jar, where readers who want to be whistleblowers or who just have complaints or who want to give us tips about things to look into can write to us anonymously. So these messages started coming from different campuses of college students who were sequestered in these special dorms for students who test positive for coronavirus. And they were describing being kind of trapped in these filthy conditions, in quarantine dorms with, like, dead bugs and mold in the walls, and, like, leaking bathrooms. But also, they felt like they\u2019d been abandoned. That the university had sort of cut them off to keep them from being contagious and infecting anybody else and then forgotten about them.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) Good morning, TikTok. So I\u2019m quarantined in my N.Y.U. dorm room for two weeks, and I can\u2019t leave. And they bring us meals every day.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so I decided I would try to find some students who were in quarantine and isolation on college campuses.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) It\u2019s 11:15. And I just got my breakfast. So let\u2019s see what it is. Because so far the food has been questionable.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd I looked at TikTok, because we\u2019d been seeing all these videos of kids on TikTok complaining about bad meals.\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) For breakfast that was delivered at 12:30 \u2014 warm grape juice. Mystery vegan muffin. Oat bar. An unripe orange. tiktok clip (college student 2) But is anyone else who goes to the University of Michigan just, like, what the [EXPLETIVE] is happening right now? And, like, terrified \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nIn addition to that, there were these students who were complaining about more profound things.\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) I think N.Y.U. saw my TikTok last night. Because it is currently 2:00 p.m. And they have not fed me all day. tiktok clip (college student 2) We were given almost no supplies. We were given no food, no masks, no gloves, no microwave, no bed sheets, no soap, no cleaning supplies. Nothing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd while I was looking at students who were more concerned \u2014\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) N.Y.U., I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings. Please feed me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\n\u2014 I saw videos by this student at the University of Alabama.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Hey, y\u2019all. This is day one of quarantine. I found out today that I have Covid and now my university has sent me to a small apartment by myself for 14 days.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd her name is Zoie Terry. And she was just documenting her experience being isolated in this dorm by herself.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) OK. I\u2019m not going to lie. This apartment is kind of scary. But we\u2019re just going to go with it. They also gave three waters. I\u2019ll keep you all updated on how I\u2019m doing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she was upbeat. And she has this huge smile. And she\u2019s completely charming. But the conditions behind her were very bleak, it seemed. So I went to the University of Alabama directory and I looked up every student named Zoie.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then, you know, I found this Zoie. And I just sent her an email saying, you know, I\u2019d like to know what it\u2019s like. I want to know what your experience was like in that isolation dorm.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd who is Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nZoie is a sophomore at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\n\nzoie terry My name is Zoie Terry. I\u2019m 19 years old. I am from Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so last year, she joined a sorority. And she was living, you know, in a freshman dorm and looking forward to the fall. But right before spring break, the coronavirus began to spread.\n\nzoie terry And then once I went home, within the hour of being home, they emailed us and told us that we weren\u2019t coming back.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd they never came back to school. Because the coronavirus shut down the campus.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did you feel about that, when that happened? zoie terry I was very upset. Me and all my friends were kind of devastated. Because we were just getting into the hang of college life. But I kind of was more freaked out because I didn\u2019t know, like, if I need to start getting my stuff ready at home to be living at home, or anything like that. Because my mom lived in a two-bedroom apartment with my twin brother and her.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she stayed at home with her mom. And they, you know, kind of banded together to wait this out.\n\nzoie terry I convinced my mom to let me get a dog. And that was kind of all I did the entire quarantine. I just watched my dog grow up, basically.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what\u2019s the status of Zoie\u2019s sophomore year? Is the university making plans to reopen?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in June, Kay Ivey, who\u2019s the governor of Alabama, announced this incredibly ambitious program to reopen the public colleges and universities in the entire state. And she puts up federal money, $30 million from, like, federal emergency coronavirus response funds to create this program to test every single student returning to college in Alabama for coronavirus before they get to school. And that could be, you know, 150,000 students.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd how are they going to do that? We keep reading about all the shortages in testing. How are you going to test over 150,000 students?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nIt\u2019s actually a fascinating story because one of the University of Alabama schools \u2014 the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2014 is a major academic medical center and has a major medical school. The governor asked the University of Alabama at Birmingham to take on this colossal testing of every returning college student. And so they ramped up their capacity to test. And they ramped up to be able to process 10 to 12,000 student coronavirus tests a day. They also set up this kind of military level logistics, where they opened 13 coronavirus testing sites for students around the state. And students had to be tested up to two weeks before they returned to campus. And the University of Alabama president and others, as they were describing this, promised that they would be the safest campuses in America when these Alabama schools reopened.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so during the summer, while all these students are getting tested, where is Alabama in terms of infections?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo by August, when the University of Alabama was gearing up to reopen, Alabama had the seventh highest per capita infection rate in the United States.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it was a calculated risk. But they felt their program was comprehensive and that they would be able to safely reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what about Zoie? Is she feeling like this is a risk?\n\nzoie terry I guess a couple weeks before school started, I was like, I felt more comfortable with the idea of going back to school, because everybody had to get tested before they even were allowed to return on campus.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo for Zoie to go back to school, she also had to get one of these tests that every other college student in Alabama was going to take.\n\nzoie terry And it came back negative. So I was allowed to come to school.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she comes back to school early before classes start, because she is going to participate in sorority rush and help interview and identify the first-year students, the girls who are going to be part of the sorority and move into the house next year.\n\nzoie terry So coming back, it was super strange. And everything looked so different because just social distancing and everything like that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYou know, usually this is a really festive, social, in-person gathering. And now they have to do rush online. They have to interview prospective sorority members virtually. But they still are putting a huge amount of energy into this. And Zoie is staying up late. And then she\u2019s waking up really, really early to help organize the rush and interview the prospective students.\n\nzoie terry And so when you have lack of sleep, you kind of start to feel a little sick. You know what I mean? But I was thinking, there was no way I could have had the virus. Because I was following every guideline. I was doing nothing. I was in my room 24/7. And so a day or two went by, and my body just felt so weak and so feverish. And I call my mom. And she\u2019s, like, you need to go get tested, just to make sure.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she gets an appointment to be tested that day. And she goes down to student health services. And she has a coronavirus test.\n\nzoie terry And it told me that I was positive. archived recording (natasha singer) And then what did you do? zoie terry So I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do. Because it was very new. So basically, I had to contact the University of Alabama Covid-19 hotline. And, like, there\u2019s a button where it\u2019s like, if you think you may have Covid, press this. If you\u2019re calling for positive test results, press this. So then I pressed that and I was assigned a case manager. And we just \u2014 she talked to me on the phone. I was having a little bit of a meltdown. I was, like, crying and hyperventilating. And she was like, are you OK? Like, I know this is so scary. But you are going to be OK, I promise you. We\u2019re going to get through this. And I will tell you exactly what to do. And I was, like OK, like, thank you so much. And I was, like, trying to calm myself down on the other side of the line. But \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she gets this email saying to her, you\u2019re going to move to this place. And there\u2019s going to be a lockbox with your key.\n\nzoie terry So I just packed all my clothes and stuff. I packed my TV. And, like, I packed my essential oil diffuser and, like, fun things like that. And try to make it as homey as possible, because I was going to be very homesick, I knew.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she gets the key. And she goes there and she opens the door. And it\u2019s kind of empty.\n\nzoie terry When I went there, there was nobody there. None of the lights were on in the buildings. And I was the only one quarantined in my apartment. I think they were just starting to quarantine people. So everything was very fresh and new to them. And \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThere\u2019s no toilet paper. And there\u2019s no, you know, sanitizer. And there\u2019s nobody to greet her, right? There\u2019s nobody from the university. There\u2019s no nurse. There\u2019s nobody in a mask. There\u2019s no security guard. There\u2019s nobody to escort her in and tell her what\u2019s going to happen and tell her who she can call. She\u2019s basically alone to fend for herself.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did that feel, going to this place by yourself? zoie terry Well, I have a lot of anxiety. So it was an experience, me first going there. And keep in mind, I also had corona. So I was very sick and very just \u2014 my emotions were very high. So I just remember I walked in, and I went straight to the furthest room, turned the lights on, shut the door. And I just sat there and started crying. I just cried for, like, five minutes. And then I pulled myself together. And I went and got my stuff from the car.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe calls her mom, who\u2019s a former I.C.U. nurse. And she calls her sister who works in New York. And she basically FaceTimes with them. And that is the beginning of what gets her through it.\n\nzoie terry So basically, my sister took what we called the day shift. First thing I would do when I wake up is call her. So I would have her on FaceTime the entire day. And my mom took the night shifts. So my mom would be on FaceTime with me throughout the night. She likes to say she monitored my breathing just in case something happened in the middle of the night where I passed out or something like that. She wanted to have my attention 24/7, in case I was like unresponsive or something. So \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBasically you were live streaming 24/7, 12 hours a day with your sister and 12 with your mom?\n\nzoie terry Yeah. I would have panic attacks. And I would think that I was, like, I couldn\u2019t breathe. But it was actually due to my anxiety and panic attacks. So I would, like, tell my mom what I was experiencing and what was happening with my health. And then she would let me know what to do from then on.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo how sick was Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe had a fever. She was exhausted. She had some breathing issues. Some of it was anxiety. But you know, it\u2019s hard to know. And so that is one of the reasons her mother wanted to monitor her. They also had a recent family tragedy. Zoie\u2019s father had a respiratory illness and he died last year. And so the fact the coronavirus was a respiratory illness, and that Zoie had it, also heightened the anxiety for the whole family and made her mom want to monitor her and act, you know, as the guardian. Because the university is not acting as a guardian of this sick student.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWhat\u2019s happening on campus as Zoie is locked in quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she really was one of the first students to go into this quarantine dorm. But as the days go by, coronavirus is spreading across campus. And so more cars are in the parking lot. A few students begin to move in. Right? And before she\u2019s moved out, there is an outbreak on campus. Kids have been going to parties without their mask on. They\u2019ve been gathering en masse in local bars in Tuscaloosa without masks on. And there is an explosion of virus cases.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Natasha, while Zoie\u2019s been in quarantine, the virus has really been taking off across campus?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYeah. And the story of how Zoie thinks she got coronavirus is indicative of how the outbreaks are spreading on campus.\n\nzoie terry The one night I had left my sorority house and had went and, like, interacted with friends, it was me and three other girls. And we had all ordered Chipotle to her house. And we all ate dinner together. And we watched a movie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she goes to call one of the friends who was at the dinner that night.\n\nzoie terry I was very nervous to call. I said, hey girl, what are you doing? And she was, like, she sounded really upset. And she goes, I\u2019m currently getting tested for Covid. And I was, like, really? That\u2019s so funny you say that. And before I could even finish my sentence, she goes, so and so has it in my house. So if you got it from this person, then I am so sorry. And I said, no, that\u2019s totally fine. I was actually calling you to tell you that I have tested positive for Covid, and that you need to get tested. And she goes, no, yeah, I\u2019m getting tested right now. So thank you for telling me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo it turned out that all the girls who were at the dinner that evening ended up getting coronavirus. And this was before classes had even started. So you can imagine how the virus started to spread as students were returning to campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo this extensive plan that the state had for testing, what went wrong?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThey tested tens of thousands of students before they came back to campus. But there was a really weak link in this testing protocol. And that was students had to be tested within two weeks of coming back to campus. But that means, like, you could test me two weeks before I go back to campus, and then I could go to a party and get Covid.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOr I might not know I have it, right, and you test me, and it takes four days to develop. And then I\u2019m going to bring my Covid with me to campus. And so there was a huge effort to do this testing. But I interviewed an epidemiologist who said it was kind of useless to test kids even a week out. And Alabama did its best. And I asked them why they used this two-week window. And they said, look, we are testing kids at scale. It was believed to be the largest student testing program in terms of higher ed anywhere in the country. And there was no way they could have processed all those 150,000 tests only two days before classes start. So they traded off getting everybody for, you know, in fact not doing it so close to the return.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo what is the situation on campus when Zoie gets out of quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo after 10 days, Zoie is finally free.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Guess what, you guys? I am done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe makes this jailbreak TikTok.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) And you might be asking yourself, Zoie, what is the first thing you do when you\u2019re free? And to that I say, I get Dunkin\u2019 with Linda!\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then she goes home to visit her mom and her dog.\n\nzoie terry And my dog \u2014 [LAUGHS] \u2014 he didn\u2019t really recognize it was me, though. It was kind of sad. Because I had the mask on \u2014 until I started speaking in my dog voice. Everybody has one. archived recording (natasha singer) Can you use your dog voice? zoie terry Oh, no. (IN DOG VOICE) I just talk like this to my Simon. He\u2019s very cute. I just talk like this to him. archived recording (natasha singer) It sounds like your own language. zoie terry He knows, he knows \u2014 if I were to say, \u201cSimon, come here\u201d in my normal voice, he wouldn\u2019t know that I was talking to him. But if I was, like, (IN DOG VOICE) \u201cSimon, come here,\u201d then he would know I was talking to him. archived recording (natasha singer) I love that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBy the time, Zoie gets back to campus, it\u2019s a completely different place. There are even more restrictions in place to try to get a handle on this virus outbreak on campus. Students are essentially confined to their room except for essential activities. They can\u2019t have any gatherings. They can\u2019t hang out in their dorms. They can\u2019t go to common spaces. The dining hall is closed except for takeout. And the bars in Tuscaloosa are closed for two weeks.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s very strange. Honestly, it\u2019s not very fun. I could be doing a way cheaper option of doing, like, a community college online instead of paying my tuition that I\u2019m paying right now.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she basically spends a lot of time in her room. The majority of her classes are now online except for one of them. And yet, she still wants to be there.\n\nzoie terry But also, I\u2019m here for like the education and the resources they have for the major I\u2019m in.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it really matters to her.\n\nzoie terry My mom and my dad both went here. And so that\u2019s why I mainly chose to come to school here, is because I am the last child out of 5 to go to college. And the only one to go to \u2018Bama. So it was kind of a given for me to come here. natasha singer So you\u2019re like the Roll Tide legacy? zoie terry Definitely. We are a big, big, big football fan family.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe\u2019s carrying on this major family tradition that is both educational and intellectual and social. And she wants to stick it out. And they all hope the university can pull this off.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s just kind of upsetting. Because my freshman year wasn\u2019t that great. Because I was just getting over the passing of my dad, and I was dealing with grief my entire freshman year. So I was kind of looking forward to my sophomore year thinking, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s going to be so much fun. Like, I\u2019m going to meet all these new people. And now that I\u2019m here and everything\u2019s happening with Covid, we can\u2019t have the sophomore year that everybody else has been able to have in years past. And I can\u2019t even imagine how the freshmen feel. I feel so bad for them. Because they\u2019re coming to college and, like, this isn\u2019t what college is like. Like, during rush, I was telling people, I was like, I promise this isn\u2019t what college is like. It\u2019s so much more fun this. And it\u2019s going to be OK. We\u2019re going to get through this. We just have to get over this hump. And once everything\u2019s better, hopefully we get a vaccine, and maybe one day things can go back to normal. But until then, we just gotta push through this time and hope for things to get better.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what is your understanding of why states and schools like the University of Alabama pushed to do this in the first place?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nI think that there are multiple factors that affect whether universities decided to reopen or not. And there are fascinating calculations that went on about what number or percent of students are going to get the virus, and what is an acceptable risk to take. And we see that some universities, even large state universities, made the decision that they were not going to reopen for in-person instruction. They were not going to bring students back to campus. Some of them made that decision for the semester and some said, look, we\u2019re going to spend the first six weeks online and we\u2019ll see what happens. And other universities made the calculation that it would be much better to reopen. It would be better for their financial interests and financial survival. It would be better for students who would have a much better experience. There\u2019s nothing that beats in-person interaction. They were going to, you know, cause education loss and emotional kind of growth loss by not opening.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nCan you explain the financial piece of that a little bit more, the financial calculation?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nRight. Well, universities obviously need tuition money and residential hall kind of dorm occupancy money and dining hall money to keep going. And yes, state schools get state money. But they also need revenue. And so there\u2019s a large financial calculation about, you know, are we going to not reopen and lose all that income? Or are we going to open and get some of that income? And are we going to open and get some of that income, knowing we\u2019re going to close, but at least we\u2019ll have reaped some of that? So there\u2019s a big picture financial driver behind deciding to reopen or not. And then there are financial decisions every step of the way. Like, OK, we\u2019re going to reopen. Are we going to reopen at full dorm occupancy and get all that money that we need for residential life? Or are we going to take a hit and actually say only freshmen and seniors can come back? And that will allow us to have only one student per room. And that will really reduce the risk, we hope, of spread of virus. But we\u2019re going to take a financial hit. And so we see universities making different calculations. Some have decided we\u2019re not going to test kids. We\u2019re only going to test kids for the virus if they show symptoms or if they\u2019ve been exposed. We see other universities, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and they have decided they\u2019re going to test every student twice a week. This is a major state university deciding the only way they can reopen safely is to test every student two times a week, week after week. Right? That is a financial calculation. They\u2019re going to spend that money because they\u2019re trying to buy down risk. And then there\u2019s the political calculation. If you are a Republican governor in a largely Republican state, where there is a debate over whether people should be required to wear masks or not, there might be other reasons why you decide that you should reopen. Because your constituents want you to reopen and your president wants you to reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd we saw Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, say recently that it is much more risky now for universities that have reopened and have large outbreaks to send students home, where they might spread the virus, than to keep them there. And so we\u2019re seeing universities that in a sense fostered virus outbreaks by reopening have to keep the virus outbreaks under control by keeping students on campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd Natasha, your reporting on what happened to Zoie and the University of Alabama first published a few days ago. What has happened since then?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOn the same day the story came out, about eight hours later, the president of the University of Alabama sent out this message to students and faculty and staff and parents. And what he said was that they were implementing these important new changes.\n\nnatasha singer Do you know that the university sent out an email after the story came out that they\u2019re going to change quarantine and isolation? zoie terry I did not know that. natasha singer Well, I\u2019m just going to read it to you.

Thank you so much. I\u2019m super happy that I had a voice in all of this. Because at the beginning when I first went into quarantine, I just sat in that room and cried because I was like, nobody\u2019s going to hear my story about this at all.

And perhaps unsurprisingly, many schools are having trouble running what are essentially disease containment units.\n\nAt the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brianna Hayes was assigned to a quarantine dorm after developing a fever. Two days later, the university informed her that she had tested positive and would need to move again, to a Covid-19 isolation dorm.\n\nThere was no university staff in the dorm to help sick students, Ms. Hayes said, and no elevator.

She said that the company\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had stated in a phone call reported by STAT \u201cthat there is no final diagnosis and that there will not be one until more tests are carried out. Those tests will be delivered to an independent safety committee that will review the event and establish a final diagnosis.\u201d\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for clarification about whether transverse myelitis was suspected.\n\nTransverse myelitis is relatively rare, sparking symptoms in roughly 1,400 people each year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. The condition can result in pain, muscle weakness, paralysis or bladder problems. Its root cause is often mysterious, although doctors believe the syndrome generally results when inflammatory responses in the body go awry, sometimes as a reaction to an ongoing or past infection, said Dr. Felicia Chow, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that we never figure out the cause,\u201d she said.\n\nThere has been some past speculation that vaccines might be able to trigger transverse myelitis, she added. A handful of vaccines have previously been tied to a smattering of other autoimmune disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, wherein the immune system attacks the nerves. Such complications, however, are rare.\n\nBoth transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been pinpointed as possible complications of Covid-19.\n\nAlthough vaccines are designed to be harmless to humans, they must still rouse the body\u2019s defenses to marshal a protective immune response. But if the wrong subsets of cells or molecules are spurred into action, or if the body cannot rein in its own responses, this could set off a cascade that starts to damage healthy tissues, said Dr. Serena Spudich, a neurologist at Yale University.", "Tucked into a small gallery in the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh is a plexiglass cube filled with computer parts.

She and her fianc\u00e9 had planned to elope this summer to Portugal \u2014 and when the pandemic canceled those plans, they ended up with a pile of refund money. They transformed a dilapidated garage into a studio. They put in a patio. And they built an elaborate cedar fence, which has become the conversation point of the neighborhood.\n\nMs. Perry works for the Idaho School Boards Association, and her life has been nonstop chaos since March. But the DIY has provided a respite: \u201cIn political advocacy, it\u2019s very hard to see a visible product you\u2019ve created,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with this, I have results, and they\u2019re complimented! We love to hang outside, because whenever we do, someone stops to say, nice fence. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Thank you, I know, it is a damn nice fence.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPart of the pleasure of DIY is doing something for your own space. But part of it, too, is talking to other people \u2014 your family, your partner, your neighborhood \u2014 about it. So many other pandemic conversations are exhausting. But not this one: \u201cHere\u2019s a good oil to use on that fence\u201d and, \u201cCan I copy it?\"\n\nFor all its pleasures, DIY obsession can also feel like a turn inward: a way of focusing on private space for private use. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time wrestling with the privilege of being able to move, back in 2017, to a place where I could afford a place with a backyard \u2014 and, once here, with having the job security to spend money on things like tomato cages and electric sanders. When my vegetables wither on the vine, or succumb to bugs or moths or lack of drainage, I tell myself: It\u2019s not about the end product. It\u2019s about the process. I realize I\u2019m desperate for a space where I can safely fail. But that, too, feels like a privilege.\n\nOne solution: figuring out how to make some of that DIY impulse benefit others, however imperfectly. For Nev Turon, who lives in Portland, Ore., with their two small children, DIY projects have been oriented around cultivating a space that\u2019s luscious and inviting \u2014 to their own family, but, eventually, to others as well. Mx. Turon has made a practice of setting up water stations in the front yard, and maintaining a small \u201cfree box\u201d of surplus items. They\u2019re working on an idea for a little free pantry, but currently lack the carpentry skills.\n\nThe real goal, however, is an outdoor shower in the backyard, available to anyone who needs it. There\u2019s already a makeshift one, but Mx. Turon wants to create a space, accessible from the outside, with a privacy curtain and enough space so a person can safely bring their possessions in with them. It\u2019s going to take time, and skills and resources Mx. Turon doesn\u2019t yet have. But it feels good to work in that direction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways to be house-less,\u201d Mx.

And even in places where there is an official mask requirement, like North Carolina, masks at the rallies are few and far between.

Mr. Trump did not.\n\nReport shows how Postal Service delivery of prescription drugs slowed under DeJoy.\n\nSenate Democrats on Wednesday released a report showing that the delivery of prescription drugs by mail slowed over the summer as Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, enacted cost-cutting changes at the United States Postal Service. That corroborates reports of delayed packages from across the country.\n\nDelivery times lengthened by as much as 32 percent, and patients had to wait, on average, an extra day or two to receive their prescriptions, the report said.\n\nSome delays were longer. According to the report, one company said, \u201cThe number of orders taking over five days to deliver has risen dramatically since the onset of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nTwo Democratic senators, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, collected information from five of the country\u2019s largest pharmacies and administrators of prescription drug programs.\n\nSome deliveries began to slow before Mr. DeJoy, a Republican megadonor and ally of President Trump, took office in June, probably because of the coronavirus pandemic and disruptions in supply chain. But the delays were exacerbated in July after Mr. DeJoy started his cost-cutting measures, the report said.", "A clear majority of American adults are worried that political pressure from the Trump administration will lead the Food and Drug Administration to rush to approve a coronavirus vaccine without making sure it is safe and effective, and nearly half hold at least one serious misconception about coronavirus prevention and treatment, according to a new poll released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe poll, which tracks public attitudes about a range of issues, found that Americans are feeling more optimistic.

It found that 62 percent of adults are worried about political pressure on the F.D.A. to approve a vaccine, with Democrats being far more worried than Republicans.\n\nAt the same time, Americans hold misconceptions about prevention and treatment of Covid-19. One in five believe wearing a face mask is harmful to your health, and one in four say hydroxychloroquine \u2014 an anti-malaria drug touted by Mr. Trump \u2014 is an effective treatment for coronavirus infection, despite clear evidence to the contrary and the F.D.A.\u2019s decision to revoke an emergency waiver for use of the medicine.\n\nAt the same time, trust in some official sources of information on the coronavirus is declining. About two in three adults \u2014 68 percent \u2014 now say they have at least a fair amount of trust in Dr. Anthony S.

Whatever either\u2019s thinking, they can both subscribe to a laxer \u201cYou Do You\u201d parenting philosophy. \u201cNot so when it comes to issues of [coronavirus] exposure,\u201d she added.\n\nWhen one parent\u2019s actions directly affect the health of the other\u2019s child, when it\u2019s not exaggerating in the least to say that our children\u2019s lives are on the line, it\u2019s no wonder that polite tolerance has gone the way of crowded music festivals. \u201cFor so many parents, these are the highest stakes they\u2019ve felt in their whole lives,\u201d said Sacks.\n\nThis fall, too many American moms (and I\u2019m deliberately saying moms, not dads or parents or families, because 80 percent of moms say they\u2019re managing the majority of home-schooling) face an impossible decision. Not a vague ideological position, an actual check-your-preferred-box-and-sign-at-the-bottom choice: Will you be sending your child back into the classroom? Committing to virtual learning? Withdrawing them entirely?\n\nYour decision can feel rife with meaning. \u201cTaking care of children is not just a thing we do anymore but a representation of who we are,\u201d said Kim Brooks, author of 2018\u2019s \u201cSmall Animals: Parenthood in the Age of Fear.\u201d In 2020, it\u2019s like someone cranked the dial on a simmering pot. \u201cWhen everybody is scared and nobody feels supported, they find a scapegoat or blame someone else. These are primitive defense mechanisms,\u201d she added.\n\nSacks sees a common psychological trapping. \u201cCompetition and criticism of others is so often a projection of insecurity and instability,\u201d she said. The pandemic is a perfect storm of both: Internally, people lack confidence to navigate a novel and unpredictable situation; externally, they lack the social and structural support systems they desperately need. Put those two things together and one can manifest as a mom-shamer.\n\nNow check your box but also read the subtext: Are you an exhausted mom desperate for normalcy? Are you a supermom who\u2019ll frantically juggle your kids\u2019 online curriculum atop your day job? A privileged mom with a pricey nanny or a private learning pod? A traditional mom willing to toss your career under the bus to home-school?", "The educator Salman Khan said that his popular online website Khan Academy draws on Mr. Robinson\u2019s teachings in part by personalizing curriculums to meet individual students\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cHe opened our eyes to an educational system that isn\u2019t fair to a lot of kids and holds back their potential,\u201d Mr. Khan said in a phone interview. \u201cHe helped a lot of educators, including myself, say, \u2018Hey, look, this is a time to change.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKenneth Robinson was born on March 4, 1950, in Liverpool, England, the fifth of seven children of James and Ethel (Allen) Robinson.

His mother was a homemaker.\n\nWhen Ken was 4, he contracted polio and was hospitalized for eight months, dashing dreams of one day playing soccer professionally. Five years later, his father was paralyzed from the neck down when he was struck by a derrick. (Mr. Robinson started using a cane 10 years ago because of complications of polio.)\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, he attended a school for children with disabilities for several years, then enrolled in a staid grammar school, where a rigorous curriculum did not include much art, drama or music \u2014 an educational experience that would inform his later career. But at a second school he attended he found excitement in a group that staged plays, one of which the teacher who helped the students asked him to direct.\n\n\u201cI thought: \u2018I can\u2019t direct the play. I\u2019ve never directed a play\u2019\u201d Mr. Robinson said in an interview with Top Hat, an education blog, in 2018. \u201cI expected the others to agree, but they all nodded and said, \u2018Yes, would you do it?\u2019 Given the unanimous vote of confidence, I agreed and loved the whole process.\u201d", "Century 21, the famous New York discount store chain, became the latest retailer felled during the pandemic, saying on Thursday that it had been forced to file for bankruptcy and would close all 13 of its locations after failing to receive money from its insurers.\n\nThe retailer said in a release that its insurance providers had not paid about $175 million due Century 21 \u201cunder policies put in place to protect against losses stemming from business interruption such as that experienced as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nRaymond Gindi, a co-chief executive and a son of a founder, noted that insurance money had helped Century 21 rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks 19 years ago.

One of Beth\u2019s favorites is a dish of stewed green beans and tomatoes, called Ayse Kadin Fasulye in Turkish. It\u2019s also an apt representation of the style of cooking she learned all those years ago in that it\u2019s stripped down and incredibly fresh.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the recipe that connects her to Murat\u2019s family, but the process. Before she does nearly anything else, she sits in the nook-like booth in her kitchen to string the beans. \u201cI love that it feels traditional,\u201d says Beth, \u201creminiscent of a simpler time. I know that for Murat, whenever he sees me doing that, it\u2019s very romantic for him. It makes him feel that we have a real home.\u201d Not that the couple has always agreed about just how that home would look. When they were designing the kitchen, they had to balance Murat\u2019s desire for tidiness with Beth\u2019s love of collecting. (Her friends, she says, might call it hoarding.)

She said that the company\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had stated in a phone call reported by STAT \u201cthat there is no final diagnosis and that there will not be one until more tests are carried out. Those tests will be delivered to an independent safety committee that will review the event and establish a final diagnosis.\u201d\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for clarification about whether transverse myelitis was suspected.\n\nTransverse myelitis is relatively rare, sparking symptoms in roughly 1,400 people each year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. The condition can result in pain, muscle weakness, paralysis or bladder problems. Its root cause is often mysterious, although doctors believe the syndrome generally results when inflammatory responses in the body go awry, sometimes as a reaction to an ongoing or past infection, said Dr. Felicia Chow, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that we never figure out the cause,\u201d she said.\n\nThere has been some past speculation that vaccines might be able to trigger transverse myelitis, she added. A handful of vaccines have previously been tied to a smattering of other autoimmune disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, wherein the immune system attacks the nerves. Such complications, however, are rare.\n\nBoth transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been pinpointed as possible complications of Covid-19.\n\nAlthough vaccines are designed to be harmless to humans, they must still rouse the body\u2019s defenses to marshal a protective immune response. But if the wrong subsets of cells or molecules are spurred into action, or if the body cannot rein in its own responses, this could set off a cascade that starts to damage healthy tissues, said Dr. Serena Spudich, a neurologist at Yale University.", "However, you must leave your home if the authorities order you to evacuate.

You can also ensure that your driveway is clear for emergency vehicles and that your address signs are clearly visible from the road.\n\nCalifornia has some of the strictest building codes in the nation, and new homes are required to be constructed with certain fire-resistant materials.

To prevent embers from flying in, enclose or box in eaves, soffits, decks and other openings in the home\u2019s structure; fine wire mesh can be used to cover vents, crawl spaces and the area underneath porches and decks. A defensible space around the perimeter of the house should be well-irrigated and free of brush, vegetation and other materials that could fuel a fire.

She and her fianc\u00e9 had planned to elope this summer to Portugal \u2014 and when the pandemic canceled those plans, they ended up with a pile of refund money. They transformed a dilapidated garage into a studio. They put in a patio. And they built an elaborate cedar fence, which has become the conversation point of the neighborhood.\n\nMs. Perry works for the Idaho School Boards Association, and her life has been nonstop chaos since March. But the DIY has provided a respite: \u201cIn political advocacy, it\u2019s very hard to see a visible product you\u2019ve created,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with this, I have results, and they\u2019re complimented!

But part of it, too, is talking to other people \u2014 your family, your partner, your neighborhood \u2014 about it. So many other pandemic conversations are exhausting. But not this one: \u201cHere\u2019s a good oil to use on that fence\u201d and, \u201cCan I copy it?\"\n\nFor all its pleasures, DIY obsession can also feel like a turn inward: a way of focusing on private space for private use. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time wrestling with the privilege of being able to move, back in 2017, to a place where I could afford a place with a backyard \u2014 and, once here, with having the job security to spend money on things like tomato cages and electric sanders. When my vegetables wither on the vine, or succumb to bugs or moths or lack of drainage, I tell myself: It\u2019s not about the end product. It\u2019s about the process. I realize I\u2019m desperate for a space where I can safely fail. But that, too, feels like a privilege.\n\nOne solution: figuring out how to make some of that DIY impulse benefit others, however imperfectly. For Nev Turon, who lives in Portland, Ore., with their two small children, DIY projects have been oriented around cultivating a space that\u2019s luscious and inviting \u2014 to their own family, but, eventually, to others as well. Mx. Turon has made a practice of setting up water stations in the front yard, and maintaining a small \u201cfree box\u201d of surplus items. They\u2019re working on an idea for a little free pantry, but currently lack the carpentry skills.\n\nThe real goal, however, is an outdoor shower in the backyard, available to anyone who needs it. There\u2019s already a makeshift one, but Mx. Turon wants to create a space, accessible from the outside, with a privacy curtain and enough space so a person can safely bring their possessions in with them. It\u2019s going to take time, and skills and resources Mx. Turon doesn\u2019t yet have. But it feels good to work in that direction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways to be house-less,\u201d Mx.

American hospitals are sealed to optimize the performance of elaborate ventilating systems, and windows are an afterthought. Many had to be expensively retrofitted to handle Covid-19 patients. Fresh air could prove necessary to help hospitals respond to contagion more flexibly and reassure patients that medical facilities are safe, Mr. Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019m dreaming of buildings that bring fresh air back into our lives,\u201d with floors that could open to outdoor balconies or garden courtyards.", "Dr. Fauci was also asked about comments he had made on Thursday in a panel discussion at Harvard Medical School, where he said \u201cwe need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d Ms. Mitchell pointed out that this conflicted with what President Trump had said at the White House on the same day, that the country had \u201crounded the final turn\u201d on the virus.\n\n\u201cI have to disagree,\u201d Dr. Fauci said of Mr. Trump\u2019s optimistic read on the situation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day and the deaths are around 1,000.\u201d He raised concerns that Labor Day could make that number rise again, as Memorial Day and the Fourth of July had done before.\n\nBut in any case, he said \u201cwhat we don\u2019t want to see is going into the fall season when people will be spending more time indoors \u2014 and that\u2019s not good for a respiratory borne virus \u2014 you don\u2019t want to start off already with a baseline that\u2019s so high.\u201d\n\nAs of Thursday, there had been an average of 35,629 cases per day over the previous week, a decrease of 16 percent from the average two weeks earlier, according to a Times database.

Though the expansion of the electorate that followed the 19th Amendment was the largest in the history of the United States, it wasn\u2019t the first or the last: The 15th Amendment enfranchised African-American men, for example, and the 26th Amendment 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds.\n\nAnd beyond the Constitution, laws and Supreme Court decisions have both expanded and restricted suffrage. For example, the Snyder Act in 1924 made all Native Americans citizens, and the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943 made it possible for Chinese immigrants to be naturalized. Through these laws, these groups gained greater access to the rights and privileges of citizenship, including voting.\n\nBut even after they had, on paper, secured the right to vote, many people of color \u2014 especially Black, Native and Latinx people \u2014 were functionally disenfranchised by poll taxes, literacy tests, white primaries and other forms of voter suppression. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 barred racial discrimination in voting. Even so, many people of color continue to struggle for access to the ballot. In 2013, the Supreme Court effectively struck down the heart of that law in Shelby County v. Holder, and voter suppression persists in many communities.\n\nInvite students to choose a topic related to voting rights and research its history.

In books and newspapers, Arabs and Muslims are typically seen through the lens of current events \u2014 foreign wars, global migration and especially terrorism. The association is so pervasive that references to it crop up even in situations that have nothing to do with terrorism. At my literary events, for example, I\u2019ve been asked many times about Al Qaeda and ISIS, as though my being Muslim grants me special insight into transnational terrorist groups that combine Islamist ideology with guerrilla tactics.\n\nMuslim Americans who appear in a public forum will, sooner or later, face that question, whether the forum is a literary event or a fashion show or the halls of power in Washington. It may take the form of an accusation, from someone who has been fed a diet of propaganda, or it may take the form of a sincere remark; it may even take the form of a joke, intended to lighten the mood of the audience. But it will come. And when it does, the Muslim faces an impossible choice: Ignore the comment and perpetuate the association with terrorism, or address the comment and perpetuate the association anyway. There is no right answer. There is only the hope, by speaking about oneself, to create room for individuality.\n\nMy own life has taken turns I could not have imagined when I stepped off a plane at Los Angeles International Airport on a late-summer afternoon in 1992. Back then, my intention had been to complete a Ph.D. in linguistics, then return home to Morocco, where I planned to work as a college professor. A couple of years into my degree, however, I met an American, we fell in love and eventually married. In choosing to be with him, I chose to embrace his country as well. That made of me an immigrant, the kind of person that America has long mythologized, in art if not in life \u2014 from the ruthless gangsters in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d to the hardworking women in \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d to the eponymous founding father in \u201cHamilton.\u201d\n\nBut even under the best of circumstances, immigration is a traumatic experience that cuts a person\u2019s life in two: There is the life before and the life after. For a long time after I moved to the United States, I wore two watches: one that told the time in Los Angeles, and the other the time in Rabat. In the morning, while I was getting ready for class, I would often think about my family, 6,000 miles away, sitting down to afternoon tea. In my memory, everyone back home remained exactly as I had last seen them, as if caught in a photograph. It never occurred to me that, day after day, they were getting older, making new friends, switching jobs or moving houses. They were changing, just as I was changing.\n\nWhenever I stepped out of my apartment, I felt keenly aware that I was speaking a foreign language, whose sentences I had to compose with deliberation before I could speak them. In graduate seminars, my classmates would chuckle or even laugh when they heard me mispronounce some words, especially those I had only known in print \u2014 \u201cepitome\u201d and \u201cfortuitous\u201d and \u201conomatopoeia.\u201d At times, the phonetic rules of English didn\u2019t make much sense to me: Why did \u201crough\u201d rhyme with \u201ctough\u201d but not with \u201cdough\u201d? Eventually I adapted to the local dialect and my foreign accent became less noticeable. One morning, a few years after arriving in this country, I woke up with the startling realization that I had dreamed in English.\n\nThe language was the easy part, however. There were so many cultural differences that hardly a day went by when I didn\u2019t notice a new one. It was not considered impolite, for example, to eat one\u2019s breakfast in front of others in the dorm\u2019s common room without offering to share it with them. It was not considered rude to invite someone to lunch at a restaurant and then expect them to pay for their meal.

As an extension project, have them come up with a question of their own to explore or research one of these topics.\n\n14. Dig deeper into the history of voting rights in the United States. Though the expansion of the electorate that followed the 19th Amendment was the largest in the history of the United States, it wasn\u2019t the first or the last: The 15th Amendment enfranchised African-American men, for example, and the 26th Amendment 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds.\n\nAnd beyond the Constitution, laws and Supreme Court decisions have both expanded and restricted suffrage. For example, the Snyder Act in 1924 made all Native Americans citizens, and the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943 made it possible for Chinese immigrants to be naturalized. Through these laws, these groups gained greater access to the rights and privileges of citizenship, including voting.\n\nBut even after they had, on paper, secured the right to vote, many people of color \u2014 especially Black, Native and Latinx people \u2014 were functionally disenfranchised by poll taxes, literacy tests, white primaries and other forms of voter suppression. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 barred racial discrimination in voting. Even so, many people of color continue to struggle for access to the ballot. In 2013, the Supreme Court effectively struck down the heart of that law in Shelby County v. Holder, and voter suppression persists in many communities.\n\nInvite students to choose a topic related to voting rights and research its history. How did this amendment, law or decision come to pass? Who worked for or against it? What motivated them? What connections can students make between this history and the women\u2019s suffrage movement?\n\n15. Learn about women\u2019s suffrage around the world. Students might research the women\u2019s suffrage movement in another country and compare it to the American movement. What similarities and differences do they notice? What inspiration did American suffragists take from those in the United Kingdom, Finland and Denmark? What patterns do they see in the reasons women fought for suffrage, whether in the United States, Brazil, Japan or Saudi Arabia? What barriers to voting do women in those countries still face?\n\n16.

Better.com\u2019s average client earns over $160,000 a year and has a FICO score of 773. As of 2017, the median household income among Black Americans was just over $38,000, and only 20.6 percent of Black households had a credit score above 700, according to the Urban Institute. This discrepancy makes it harder for fintech companies to boast about improving access for the most underrepresented borrowers.\n\nGhost in the machine\n\nSoftware has the potential to reduce lending disparities by processing enormous amounts of personal information \u2014 far more than the C.F.P.B. guidelines require. Looking more holistically at a person\u2019s financials as well as their spending habits and preferences, banks can make a more nuanced decision about who is likely to repay their loan. On the other hand, broadening the data set could introduce more bias. How to navigate this quandary, said Ms. McCargo, is \u201cthe big A.I. machine learning issue of our time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, lenders cannot consider race, religion, sex, or marital status in mortgage underwriting. But many factors that appear neutral could double for race. \u201cHow quickly you pay your bills, or where you took vacations, or where you shop or your social media profile \u2014 some large number of those variables are proxying for things that are protected,\u201d Dr. Wallace said.\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t know how often fintech lenders ventured into such territory, but it happens.

And likely much more than that.

He and other leaders of Warp Speed were present at Friday\u2019s news conference but not asked to comment.\n\nIn interviews with CNN and National Public Radio, Dr. Slaoui has said he expected only enough vaccine to immunize 20 million to 25 million people by year\u2019s end. Enough to vaccinate all Americans would be ready by about the middle of next year, he said.", "Culturally too, we are usually treated as a separate race, hence our almost universal portrayal as villains or victims in popular media. In books and newspapers, Arabs and Muslims are typically seen through the lens of current events \u2014 foreign wars, global migration and especially terrorism. The association is so pervasive that references to it crop up even in situations that have nothing to do with terrorism. At my literary events, for example, I\u2019ve been asked many times about Al Qaeda and ISIS, as though my being Muslim grants me special insight into transnational terrorist groups that combine Islamist ideology with guerrilla tactics.\n\nMuslim Americans who appear in a public forum will, sooner or later, face that question, whether the forum is a literary event or a fashion show or the halls of power in Washington. It may take the form of an accusation, from someone who has been fed a diet of propaganda, or it may take the form of a sincere remark; it may even take the form of a joke, intended to lighten the mood of the audience. But it will come. And when it does, the Muslim faces an impossible choice: Ignore the comment and perpetuate the association with terrorism, or address the comment and perpetuate the association anyway. There is no right answer. There is only the hope, by speaking about oneself, to create room for individuality.\n\nMy own life has taken turns I could not have imagined when I stepped off a plane at Los Angeles International Airport on a late-summer afternoon in 1992. Back then, my intention had been to complete a Ph.D. in linguistics, then return home to Morocco, where I planned to work as a college professor. A couple of years into my degree, however, I met an American, we fell in love and eventually married. In choosing to be with him, I chose to embrace his country as well. That made of me an immigrant, the kind of person that America has long mythologized, in art if not in life \u2014 from the ruthless gangsters in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d to the hardworking women in \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d to the eponymous founding father in \u201cHamilton.\u201d\n\nBut even under the best of circumstances, immigration is a traumatic experience that cuts a person\u2019s life in two: There is the life before and the life after. For a long time after I moved to the United States, I wore two watches: one that told the time in Los Angeles, and the other the time in Rabat. In the morning, while I was getting ready for class, I would often think about my family, 6,000 miles away, sitting down to afternoon tea. In my memory, everyone back home remained exactly as I had last seen them, as if caught in a photograph. It never occurred to me that, day after day, they were getting older, making new friends, switching jobs or moving houses. They were changing, just as I was changing.\n\nWhenever I stepped out of my apartment, I felt keenly aware that I was speaking a foreign language, whose sentences I had to compose with deliberation before I could speak them. In graduate seminars, my classmates would chuckle or even laugh when they heard me mispronounce some words, especially those I had only known in print \u2014 \u201cepitome\u201d and \u201cfortuitous\u201d and \u201conomatopoeia.\u201d At times, the phonetic rules of English didn\u2019t make much sense to me: Why did \u201crough\u201d rhyme with \u201ctough\u201d but not with \u201cdough\u201d? Eventually I adapted to the local dialect and my foreign accent became less noticeable. One morning, a few years after arriving in this country, I woke up with the startling realization that I had dreamed in English.\n\nThe language was the easy part, however. There were so many cultural differences that hardly a day went by when I didn\u2019t notice a new one. It was not considered impolite, for example, to eat one\u2019s breakfast in front of others in the dorm\u2019s common room without offering to share it with them. It was not considered rude to invite someone to lunch at a restaurant and then expect them to pay for their meal. If I sound singularly focused on food, perhaps it\u2019s because food is so intimately tied to culture. It seemed to me that Americans were always rushing around, never taking the time to sit down for a cup of coffee or a proper dinner. I was shocked the first time I saw a woman eating a hamburger as she drove down the 10 freeway.\n\nMy story of immigration has been enriched by the love of my husband and family, the joy of enduring friendships, the fulfillment I find in my work.

At the same time, parents should express confidence in the child\u2019s ability: We know picking up the phone is hard for you, but we\u2019re sure you can do it.\n\nDr. Kurtz recommended that parents focus on small steps that let children practice using their voices, like running a pretend restaurant for each relative individually instead of wading into a family gathering all at once."], "20200929": [], "20200930": []}
