It is the freedom of change, and a key to be utilized to mold a brighter future. I see our democracy our ability to hold an opinion, popular or not. It is the skin that protects our vocal cords, and the microphone that keeps our voices from being drowned out. It secures our vote and allows us to use that vote to speak out against injustice. The most important part of our democracy is the respect it secures for our human rights, but in the end it is an opportunity, and that opportunity can be ignored. If we do not take the initiative to nurture and cultivate our democracy it will grow weak. Even a tool as powerful as democracy is worthless when left unused.\n\n\u2014 Aldon Aquarian, Cass High School, GA\n\nMaking the Political Personal\n\nThe biggest threat to democracy is not being open to listening and hearing out someone, regardless of whether you want to agree or disagree with them. I feel that the nuances of many issues are lost in this way, as people are too quick to judge those different from them. Having healthy and open discussions with each other is the key to keeping our democracy alive. Personally, I thoroughly enjoy having conversations with people whose ideologies and opinions greatly differ from mine as I gain perspective and understanding\n\n\u2014 Lucy Wu, Valley Stream North High School\n\nA few years ago I became passionate about the Israel Palestine conflict. I wanted to do anything I could to help so I began the search for an activism group that was seeking to help those most hurt by the conflict, the Palestinian peoples. I found a group called Kids for Peace and the next thing I knew I was on a plane to Washington, DC. I had two weeks there where we would meet with professors, religious members, and people who came from both sides of the issue. They were all able to help us form our strategy to convince Senators why they should support our emergency relief bill for residents in the conflict area. We spent days in congress lobbying to dozens for Representatives and Senators trying to convince them to help those we thought needed it the most. A few months after the trip we heard the news that $50 million in aid had been approved. It was extremely rewarding for me to know that something that I took part in would go on to help so many people who didn\u2019t have a voice of their own.\n\n\u2014 Summit Sularz, Burlington, VT\n\nMr. Lewis echoes Martin Luther King\u2019s sentiment about having a moral obligation to speak up and act when we see injustice. I agree with this idea, as tolerating injustice leads to a passive society that is willing to make minimal reforms to flaws in its political system. Many ordinary people have been speaking out against injustices. Currently, attention is being drawn to the racism in the United States justice system \u2026 I participated in direct action against anti-black racism through protests, monetary contributions to organizations, and introspection into my own racial biases. However, becoming an anti-racist is a lifelong process, and I will have to continue to make efforts throughout my entire life.\n\n\u2014 Karina Johnston, Glenbard West HS\n\nMy generation has turned to their platforms to inform about topics including racial justice, climate change, COVID updates, economic issues, women\u2019s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and the Trump administration \u2026 Although social media is a great informative tool, the real work \u2014 the work of Dr. King and John Lewis and the strengthening of democracy \u2014 takes place in one\u2019s house, community, school, place of worship, workplace, and, most importantly, at the polls and in the legislative process. For underage people, there are various ways to contribute: become a poll worker, help the campaigning process, advocate for policies in local government, engage in voter education, encourage older peers to vote, research candidates, volunteer to help register people to vote, etc. For those over 18, they can and should use their vote. This is how we rise to the challenges. This is how we strengthen our democracy.\n\n\u2014 Caitlin Bal\u00f3n, South Burlington, Vermont\n\nUsing Social Media: Activism, Slacktivism, and Cancel Culture\n\nI believe that my generation is doing its part to maintain democracy in the United States. Since the Black Lives Matter movement took off to the levels it did in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, people in my grade have been voicing their opinions on the things that need to be changed in our society on a daily basis. They have been using platforms like Instagram and Facebook to voice their opinions on the ongoing injustice in our country. Even though they still do not have the right to vote yet, they still have voiced their opinions through social media \u2014 the exact thing that civil rights icon John Lewis called on our generation to do. Lewis said that he knew he wanted to fight for change from the young age of fifteen, which is about the age that people in Gen Z are right now. Democracy, by definition, is allowing the people to have a say in social issues, and people voicing their opinions on social issues is the perfect example of democracy, as the great leader John Lewis did before his recent death.\n\n\u2014 Sam Casas, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, IL\n\nI believe that our generation has risen up to the challenges that Mr. Lewis described in his essay. Especially in the past few months, all around the country our generation has taken part in and organized protests against police brutality and the social injustices we see in our country today. Our generation is using social media, which the past generations did not have as much access too, to make sure that our voices are heard and accounted for. Senator Lewis was strongly against violence and I believe our generation is doing a good job of peacefully protesting for change. With the 2020 election approaching this November, our generation is pushing everyone who is eligible to vote to do so, doing their part to strengthen the democracy and let their voices be heard. Our generation still has a lot of work to be done: however, I believe Generation Z is on the right track.\n\n\u2014 Jack Hasselbach, Burlington, VT", "The circumstances and motivations vary. For some couples, moving in together on relatively brief acquaintance seems like an eminently logical next step in the relationship at a time when making a connection has taken on a singular, almost wartime, carpe diem urgency. (And never mind the mutters of \u201cpremature\u201d from outside observers.)\n\nFor some it\u2019s unplanned, more than anything a quirk of timing. For others, it\u2019s a convenience or perhaps a bid to bolster the odds of a relationship\u2019s survival. What with the difficulties of travel during the pandemic, if couples don\u2019t decide to see each other morning, noon and night, goes the thinking, it\u2019s going to be all but impossible to see each other at all.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Mr. Tyler and Ms. Swoboda hadn\u2019t known each other long when they decided to quarantine together. But they are quick to point out the difference between quality and quantity time, and equally quick to point out that their few dates were very long dates, affording them lots of time to discuss personal values, long-term goals \u2014 and who should take out the garbage. \u201cBecause of the pandemic, there was nothing to do and no place to go, so the intimate conversations started right away and self-disclosure happened much more quickly,\u201d Mr. Tyler said.\n\n\u201cLiving together early in a relationship is hardly new,\u201d said Arlene Kagle, a clinical psychologist in Richmond, Va. \u201cWhat is new is that in this period of isolation, couples are together many, many more hours of the day than they would be under normal circumstances. And,\u201d Dr. Kagle continued, \u201cthat forced togetherness creates a greater sense of shared beliefs and a greater sense of intimacy.\u201d\n\nIt also creates a sense of \u201cif we can do this, we can do anything. If we can be happily together 24 hours a day, obviously we\u2019re a great couple.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople may feel well positioned to make a long-term commitment,\u201d Dr. Kagle said. \u201cWhether they\u2019re correct remains to be seen.\u201d", "Eventually, I started dreaming bigger. I somehow persuaded my partner, Maggie, that after nine months exclusively in each other\u2019s company, a multiday bike trip was just what we needed.\n\nI picked a destination \u2014 the house of some friends in the Catskills\u2019 southern reaches I had long been promising to visit \u2014 and started planning our route. It would be 220 miles round trip, split into four days of riding, with two days in our friends\u2019 converted RV behind their house. I had no idea whether this is something that people did on bicycles. It surely wasn\u2019t something I would have considered before 2020.\n\nAs the trip approached, I pored over online maps, recreating our route through Google Street View. I obsessed over the weather forecast. I washed the bicycles. When the day arrived, we packed everything up, strapped the bags to our bikes, and we were off. I had no illusions that this would be a carefree jaunt through Europe, where transcontinental bike trails stretch from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. It would not even be like some of the more popular touring routes out West, where extensive infrastructure is built around cycling. But it was not nearly as harrowing as I secretly feared it might be.\n\nWe rode 9W until Nyack, N.Y., where we turned off onto a gravel track that wrapped the edge of Hook Mountain State Park, taking us along the riverbank and up steep inclines into thick forests. I was concerned that stretches like this might prove difficult for Maggie, who rides a skinny-tired road bike.\n\nThough I had been training all summer, Maggie had never cycled more than 50 miles in one stretch \u2014 but she did so every day for four days without ever running out of steam. It is a testament to what good shape she is in (and how out of shape I was after a year spent in hotels and rental cars). She flew by me on tricky, gravelly descents. When she got stung in the leg by a wasp, she tucked an ice pack under the edge of her bike shorts and kept riding.\n\nPast the park, we continued through the town of Haverstraw, in Rockland County, where we wished we could have stopped for lunch, shocked by the sheer concentration of Mexican restaurants and bakeries. But intent on avoiding riding after dark, we continued on. Eventually, after crossing to the eastern side of the Hudson via the Bear Mountain Bridge, we finished the day in Cold Spring, where we rewarded our day\u2019s efforts with beer and pizza. We had covered 51 miles. The next day, after a luxurious in-room breakfast (perfect for social distancing) at the quaint Pig Hill Inn, we were back on the road.", "Some of the worst offenders, in terms of killing off other forms of life, are plants: Kudzu, an Asian vine intentionally spread to combat erosion through the American South by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression, strangles trees and blocks out the sunlight that lower-lying plants need to thrive; garlic mustard, from Europe, has roots that leach a toxic chemical, making the soil uninhabitable by its rivals. Japanese knotweed, which in its home country is held in check by local grasses and insects, elsewhere burrows deep and wide \u2014 one plant\u2019s rhizomes were reported to extend 32,000 square feet \u2014 and is almost unmatched in the botanical world in its sheer capacity for destruction, strong enough to break through asphalt, concrete and the floors and walls of houses. Knotweed must be dug out by the roots and smothered, for if you leave as much as a half-inch fragment behind, the battle is lost. In Britain, it\u2019s classified as controlled waste, to be disposed of only by licensed specialists, and those who fail to contain knotweed infestations on their property may be charged under the 2014 Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act. (Its hollow stems are tart and crunchy, akin to rhubarb and common in Japanese cuisine.)\n\nTo combat the specter of a monocultural future, universities and ecologically minded organizations from Oregon to Georgia now host annual invasive-species-themed cook-offs, fund-raisers and feral-hog roasts, where diners might sample salads laced with weeds and smash a pi\u00f1ata shaped like the iridescent Japanese beetle, which arrived on our shores a century ago in a shipment of iris bulbs and has chomped its way across the lawns of America ever since. At least one state, Maryland, has started putting the blue catfish, indigenous to the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico and now gobbling up blue crabs in the Chesapeake Bay, on menus at state institutions, including schools, hospitals and prisons.\n\nThe theory goes that the more people eat invasive species, the more incentive there is to hunt and harvest them \u2014 a classic free-market approach, except that the point is to boost demand until there is no supply. Should diners in fact grow fond of these novelties, the plan could backfire, recasting the species as a valued commodity. (In 1902, the French colonial government in Hanoi, Vietnam, hellbent on slaughtering the city\u2019s rats, offered a bounty for each rodent tail delivered as proof of execution; cunning entrepreneurs simply chopped off the tails and released the rats, leaving them free to breed and produce more rats, hence more tails and more bounties.)\n\nThe challenge is to convince consumers that something labeled bad is also good: pernicious but delicious. Another rodent, the nutria, is a particularly tough sell. A 14-pound creature with long orange teeth, it lurks in swamps. It was brought to Louisiana from Argentina in the 1930s to be bred for its plush pelt, which once adorned the shoulders of Greta Garbo and Elizabeth Taylor. Since the late 1980s, when the fur industry started to shrink under pressure from animal-rights activists, the giant rats \u2014 long gone feral in the Louisiana wetlands \u2014 have multiplied, gnawing at plant roots in the marshes and leaving a wake of razed vegetation equal to 10 times the amount of each mouthful they take. Robert A. Thomas, a biologist and director of the Center for Environmental Communication at Loyola University New Orleans, was among the first to offer a culinary solution to the problem. In 1993, he recruited the chef Paul Prudhomme to transform the erstwhile pest into gumbo and \u00e9touff\u00e9e for what would become, for a few years, an annual Nutriafest.

Why should the federal government subsidize public broadcasting, conservative politicians and others ask, when the commercial marketplace appears to be doing just fine delivering those types of programs?\n\nFrom its beginnings, PBS has grappled with an existential conundrum \u2014 what it should be, and how it should distinguish itself. Thanks to its success, that quandary has become even thornier. More than ever, a thriving future for PBS will come down to how it manages an organization for the public good in a commercial environment, according to Marcia Smith, a documentary film producer (\u201cThe Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution\u201d).\n\n\u201cIs there still an idea of the public good that we can agree on beyond \u2018Sesame Street\u2019?,\u201d Smith asked.\n\nHow It Came Together\n\nPBS is an odd entity to celebrate, really. It\u2019s a \u201cservice\u201d not a \u201csystem,\u201d and not a network like CBS or CNN. Officially, it distributes national programs that it does not produce, and it is charged with operating the satellite system to interconnect all local public television stations. PBS did not originate noncommercial, educational television; there were already more than 100 such stations when PBS debuted in October 1970. \u201cThe French Chef\u201d was its first broadcast, but the program had been airing on some public stations for six years. \u201cSesame Street\u201d had begun a year earlier.\n\nBut it\u2019s an anniversary worth commemorating. PBS and public television are now widely considered synonymous, having met the goal envisioned by its founders: helping autonomous educational stations nationwide combine resources, amplifying the reach of quality programs and shepherding new ones worthy of the federal funds allotted under the 1967 Public Broadcasting Act. Those stations, while committing to a common purpose, ultimately retain control over what they air. Call it upside-down, or bottom-up, as Paula Kerger, the president and chief executive of PBS, does. \u201cYou have a lot of responsibility, but not ultimate authority,\u201d she said of PBS\u2019s role.

We will simply focus our review on the many other items in the application that highlight each student\u2019s strengths and perspective.", "Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 2021.\n\nThink of a task you have to do: perhaps study for a test, practice the guitar, clean your room \u2014 or complete this writing prompt.\n\nIs it easy for you to stay focused and concentrate, or does your mind drift and wander? Do you quickly begin to daydream, check your social media feed, think about a snack or the news? Are you distracted by constant dings and alerts from your phone or the sound of your siblings arguing in the background? In short, do you find yourself thinking about everything but the task at hand?\n\nDo you wish you could improve your focus and learn to avoid distractions? If so, you are not alone.\n\nIn \u201cYou Can Get Focused (Hint: Put Down That Phone),\u201d Caren Osten Gerszberg writes:\n\nThe average person\u2019s mind wanders 47 percent of the time, according to a 2010 Harvard study, so nearly half the time you\u2019re doing one thing, you\u2019re thinking about something else. Add the 24-hour news cycle, the barrage of social media and the countless distractions for those working from their bedrooms, backyards and walk-in closets \u2014 a number that has more than quadrupled from 8.2 percent in February 2020 to 35.2 percent in May 2020, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \u2014 and it\u2019s no surprise that people are struggling to focus. \u201cSome would argue that human attention, not money, is the most valuable commodity there is,\u201d said Angela Duckworth, the author of \u201cGrit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance,\u201d and the founder and scientific director of Character Lab, a nonprofit that connects researchers with educators. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate scarce resource.\u201d\n\nMs. Osten Gerszberg presents several techniques to cultivate and improve focus and to learn to ignore distractions. Here are three excerpts:\n\nDisengage from distractions For at-home workers struggling with distraction, a recent survey revealed that social media is the leading cause \u2014 many reported wasting up to two hours a day \u2014 with children coming in second. You can reduce those distracting dings, tweets and rings coming from your social media feeds, emails and text messages by simply turning off the notifications. That\u2019s right, just turn them off. If that feels radical, you can attempt turning away from technology using self-control, but as Dr. Duckworth said, \u201cwillpower is a limiting resource, it\u2019s unpleasant and we\u2019re not willing to do it for very long, so the best thing to do is create a situation where it\u2019s just harder to be distracted.\u201d In her research on self-control in teenagers, data showed that the farther away students placed their phone while studying, the higher their grades. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to control your attention, don\u2019t just try to do it with willpower,\u201d she said. \u201cYou literally need to hack your physical space.\u201d When your focus wanes and you feel the urge to online shop or grab a game of 2048, there are tech tools to prevent your giving in. The Freedom app blocks websites from your computer and smartphone; Forest has you set a timer encircling the image of a tree; if you pick up your phone before the time is completed, the tree withers and dies. Exercise Allotting time for exercise is a proven way to improve focus, memory and productivity. A British study found that workers experienced a 21 percent increase in concentration and a 41 percent increase in motivation on the days they worked out. Check in with yourself The state of the world is enough to fog anyone\u2019s brain. \u201cThe reason we lose focus most of the time is because we are looking to escape some kind of discomfort, such as stress, anxiety, loneliness or boredom,\u201d said Nir Eyal, the author of the book \u201cIndistractable.\u201d If watching or reading the news increases your anxiety, limit the time you spend doing it. If you feel lonely or disconnected, schedule time in your day to speak with family or friends. If you\u2019re bored, take a break and pursue a new hobby. Mindfulness meditation involves paying attention to the present moment \u2014 your thoughts, emotions and sensations \u2014 whatever is happening. Research has shown that mindfulness practices improve working memory and focus, training the mind to let go of distractions. \u201cThe digital world has been engineered for distraction, and with quick hits from social media, we don\u2019t see how unrewarding these distractions are,\u201d said Judson Brewer, the director of research and innovation at Brown University\u2019s Mindfulness Center and associate professor of psychiatry at the university\u2019s medical school. Dr. Brewer suggests experimenting by leaving on all your phone\u2019s dings and tweets for 20 minutes and asking yourself: \u201cHow focused can I get? What does it feel like?\u201d Then turn off all the notification sounds for 20 minutes and ask the same questions.\n\nStudents, read the entire article, then tell us:\n\nHow well can you concentrate when you have a task to do?

Tell us any strategies that you use to concentrate effectively.\n\nWhat do you think about Ms. Osten Gerszberg\u2019s advice? Which of the strategies that she recommends \u2014 like reducing those distracting dings, tweets and rings coming from your social media feeds or placing your phone at a far distance \u2014 are you most likely to try? Why? Are there any other strategies you have used to reduce distractions?\n\nDr. Duckworth says, \u201cSome would argue that human attention, not money, is the most valuable commodity there is.\u201d Do you agree?

So, I can understand why students thought that it was still required. But this year the admissions dean at Chicago told me it might only get 50 percent of students submitting a score. You\u2019ll be in good company if you don\u2019t have a score.\n\nI get that students from top high schools want to do everything to improve their chances at a selective college, but I wonder if the test score might be that thing this year. Remember, research shows that students tend to score higher the more often they take the ACT and SAT. Maybe students will be able to take the test once this fall, but coupled with last spring\u2019s cancellations, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll have more than one score by the time they apply. So many applicants this year won\u2019t be helped by the so-called superscore, the number that combines the highest verbal and math score, no matter the test date.\n\nImage Jeffrey Selingo\u2019s latest book about college admissions was published in September.\n\nHow about merit aid, because test scores also are used in awarding those tuition discounts?\n\nColleges that are test-optional in admissions should be the same when it comes to financial aid, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to check with the financial-aid office. Again, to enroll a class, colleges need to offer those discounts. If half the applicants don\u2019t have a test score, the college can\u2019t simply ignore them.\n\nMany financial-aid directors I talk with tell me they\u2019re still running scenarios on how to award that aid without test scores, but it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll use high school grades more than in the past.", "Swimming: Add Mixed Gender Relays\n\nMy favorite sport, swimming, provides me with a sense of pride and joy. I relate to the professional swimmers I watch on television because I comprehend the amount of work they put into the pool to occasionally drop milliseconds of time in an event. It can be gruesome, but I find myself absorbed by the vital details that many sports lack- yardage, pace work, strokes, underwaters, etc. However, there are changes I\u2019d like to see that would change the sport for the better, like mixed gender relays. This would mean two males and two females each swim an equal distance in a specific order while racing other mixed gender relays. I think this would add some diversity to the sport, as well as making great TV.\n\n\u2014 Annie Andres, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn\n\nVolleyball: Change the Back Row Rules\n\nI personally think that in volleyball, there are too many rules with letting back row hit the ball. With the typical D Pike A formation, its simple, but once you add the rule that they have to stay behind the 10 foot line to hit, it becomes more of a hassle than just letting them hit by the net. It doesn\u2019t make sense that the strongest passers have to also have the strongest swing, because if you stay behind the 10 foot line to hit, than you have not only make the ball go farther, you also need to way more power than someone who is a middle or an outside hitter. It also makes it harder on a setter to push the ball farther off the net than their regular set up by the net. In all, volleyball is my favorite sport to play and to watch, I just wish that some rules would be abolished from the rule books to make the game more enjoyable for the players.\n\n\u2014 Grace V, IPoly High\n\nFigure Skating: Positive Changes Came After Quarantine\n\nAs a figure skater, the start of quarantine was supposed to be the start of a new skating season \u2026. Before the pandemic, for each competition you always had to arrive at least an hour before to check-in. I have always felt that an hour was too much and added unnecessary stress. Now to limit the people in the building coming in close contact for a long amount of time, the check-in is around 25 minutes and I am in the rink 20 minutes before my event. This way you have time to warm-up, check your hair and costume, tie your skates, and be ready to go on. Before this, you would always have around another 30 minutes of just sitting or walking around the rink stressing out. Another great change that has occur in figure skating competitions, is waiting for the results after the competition. After you have skated, you would wait another hour to get your results and critics. Now, results are posted conveniently online and you can see them on your way home. Overall, I think quarantine has evoked a much needed change in the way figure skating competitions are carried out.\n\n\u2014 Elizabet Mikhina, Glenbard West High\n\nN.H.L.: Or Boxing?\n\nI like watching hockey, but it would be much better if they removed all the boring figure skating and made it all about the combat.\n\n\u2014 Stanley S., JR Masterman School, Philadelphia, PA\n\nCheerleading and Competitive Dance: Call My Sport a Sport\n\nMost of the people who say cheerleading is not a sport are people who play other sports like basketball or baseball. I am an All Star cheerleader, but I have also done school competitive cheer where we go to nationals. In my opinion any competitive type of cheerleading is definitely a sport, but when it comes to sideline cheer I understand why some people consider it not a sport. In my opinion cheerleading is one of the hardest sports, and one of if not the sport that needs the most athleticism and stamina. I have played a lot of sports, and cheered since I was three, I feel like the hardest sport that I have ever done is cheerleading. I feel like if another sport tried to do my teams cheer routine they would not be able to push through it. Cheerleading requires a whole different group of muscles and strength then other sports. In conclusion cheerleading is a sport, and I believe people should look more into it before they say something.\n\n\u2014 RC, J. R. Masterman School, Philadelphia, PA\n\nDance has always been a large part of my life. My mom put me in ballet class at age two, and ever since then I have had a growing passion for the art. I started competing when I was in fifth grade, and I am still on that same competition team to this day. What I believe makes dance so appealing and thrilling is the never ending challenges you face. You are always pushing yourself to perform better than the last performance, or train harder than the day before \u2026 However, one thing that is missing in the dance world is how others perceive the art/sport. I say \u201cart/sport\u201d because it really is both. Many people assume that dance is only an art because you are just spinning around on your tippy toes and never breaking a sweat. This is very false. All dancers can attest to the fact that behind closed doors, dance is a vigorous and physically draining sport. The beauty of dance is that we are able to stretch so far past the limits of a normal human body, while making it look pleasing and \u201ceasy\u201d to the eye.\n\n\u2014 Mary Crum, Glenbard West High School\n\n_________\n\nWhat Story Could This Image Tell?"], "20201015": [], "20201016": [], "20201017": [], "20201018": [], "20201019": [], "20201020": [], "20201021": [], "20201022": ["There\u2019s a word that political scientists use \u2014 \u201csalience\u201d \u2014 that applies.

Their bottom line is, how does this affect me?\u201d\n\nII.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan defeated the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, in the 1980 presidential election, exit polls showed that women favored him by a slim 2-percentage-point margin but that he won the male vote 55 to 36 percent. The last time the gender gap was that big was the 1950s, but at that point \u2014 and traditionally \u2014 it was women who were the more conservative voters, which was largely attributed to their greater religiosity.\n\nPolling is consistent that women are more likely to favor government spending on social issues, and that is likely one reason the gender gap emerged in 1980. Mr. Reagan campaigned aggressively to starve big government and shrink generous social programs, railing against \u201cwelfare queens\u201d at a time when women, many of them poor, were increasingly heads of single-parent households. He fell in line with the Republican Party\u2019s strong anti-abortion stance, even though he had signed liberal abortion legislation as governor of California.\n\nSome argued that the gender gap emerged because women were voting in their self-interest. But the sociologist Martin Gilens, now the chairman of the public policy department at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, took issue with that idea.\n\nIn a paper published in the Berkeley Journal of Sociology late in Mr. Reagan\u2019s first term, he wrote, \u201cI do not believe that \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 such as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) or abortion, nor economic conditions such as the growing number of impoverished women, are primarily responsible for the gender gap, though they may play a part.\u201d Instead, he continued, \u201cI think the gender gap reflects traditional differences in male and female values and personalities, differences such as men\u2019s greater competitiveness and concerns with issues of power and control, and women\u2019s greater compassion and nurturance, rejection of force and violence, and concern with interpersonal relations.\u201d"], "20201023": [], "20201024": [], "20201025": [], "20201026": [], "20201027": [], "20201028": [], "20201029": [], "20201030": [], "20201031": []}
