Acts to Ease Sentence for a Trump Ally\u201d (front page, Feb. 12):\n\nThe interference of senior Justice Department officials in the Roger Stone case is a particularly ominous affront to the rule of law. It is but a short step from intervening on behalf of one of the president\u2019s allies to intervening to ensure harsher punishment for his enemies.\n\nIf Attorney General William Barr acted to advance the president\u2019s political agenda, he violated his oath of office and should be impeached.\n\nAs for the prosecutors who withdrew from the case and the prosecutor who resigned, I commend them for having the integrity to protest the appalling breach of public trust by senior officials. They are heroes, and I fervently hope that they will someday find themselves on the team assigned to prosecute our lawless president and his henchmen.\n\nGary Mongiovi\n\nNew York\n\nThe Travails of Poverty\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cRisk of Losing Benefits From Everyday Errors\u201d (news article, Jan. 30):\n\nThe quiz that appeared online with the article accurately describes the enormous administrative burdens placed on my clients, homeless individuals and families in New York City, in order to establish their eligibility for shelter, food stamps, Medicaid and cash assistance."], "20200212": [], "20200213": [], "20200214": [], "20200215": [], "20200216": [], "20200217": [], "20200218": [], "20200219": [], "20200220": [], "20200221": [], "20200222": [], "20200223": [], "20200224": [], "20200225": [], "20200226": [], "20200227": [], "20200228": [], "20200229": []}
