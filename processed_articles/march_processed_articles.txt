Children\u2019s brains are still developing. If you don\u2019t let them develop these skills, she said, \u201cThe part of their brain that\u2019s supposed to be maturing in a more responsible way has shifted.\u201d\n\nDr. Joseph F. Hagan Jr., a clinical professor in pediatrics at the University of Vermont, was also concerned about the subliminal messages this kind of monitoring may be sending children. The risk to their social and emotional development isn\u2019t just about threats to their autonomy; it\u2019s also about the anxiety that can arise from \u201cbeing exposed to a world being painted to them as dangerous, when it\u2019s not all that dangerous,\u201d Dr. Hagan said. There is some evidence that anxiety among children is on the rise \u2014 a study published in 2018 showed that diagnoses of anxiety for children 6 to 17 rose nearly 20 percent from 2003 to 2012 \u2014 and we don\u2019t need to add to it, especially considering that children are far safer by many measures than they were 50 years ago.\n\nIndeed, the risk of a child being kidnapped by someone they don\u2019t know \u2014 the most extreme parental fear meant to be soothed by a GPS tracker \u2014 is vanishingly small in the United States. The vast majority of missing children are runaways, and children running away are not going to take their smartwatches with them. Furthermore, even in that rare case of kidnapping by a stranger, a GPS tracking watch cannot guarantee a child\u2019s safety. The kidnapper could turn off the watch or throw it out the window. Motivated kidnappers aren\u2019t even deterred by GPS tracking microchips implanted in a person\u2019s body; there was a case in Mexico in 2010 where kidnappers reportedly dug a microchip out of a man\u2019s arm with scissors.\n\nI asked my friend\u2019s daughter how she felt about the fact that her father checked in on her location from time to time. \u201cWell, I am a little creeped out by it, because my dad can know where I am,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, it makes me feel a bit safer. I doubt I\u2019m going to get kidnapped, but if I do get kidnapped, he could find me and call the police.\u201d When I asked her if she thought about getting kidnapped before she got her Gizmo, she said not really \u2014 perhaps illustrating Dr. Hagan\u2019s point about making the world seem more dangerous. Many of her friends have Gizmos and a few already have phones. \u201cI don\u2019t think my dad would really let me walk to school if I didn\u2019t have one,\u201d she said, but over all, the tracking doesn\u2019t bother her \u2014 she has accepted the digital tether; it\u2019s her normal. \u201cI don\u2019t really care because he\u2019s not looking at it that much.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that smartwatches for kids don\u2019t have any benefits. As Heather Kirkorian, associate professor of human development and family studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that, for example, their texting and phone call functionality can be useful in a world where pay phones aren\u2019t available the way they used to be. My friend\u2019s daughter loved the fact that she could call her friends using the Gizmo and that it opened up a new mode of communication with her family. And certainly for children with special needs who may not be as independent as other children their age, the GPS tracking feature makes more sense. (Indeed, there is a tracker designed especially for children with autism: AngelSense.)\n\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m talking to parents about using technology, I\u2019m always focused on what the goal is,\u201d Dr. Kirkorian said. The most important thing is the relationship between the parent and the child. If the monitoring is temporary and given along with new responsibilities, that\u2019s one thing. But if it\u2019s a permanent invasion of privacy \u2014 that\u2019s far from ideal. As kids get into their teen years, being tracked can undermine trust between parents and children, as Lisa Damour, a psychologist, pointed out in the Times in 2018.\n\nThere has always been tension, Dr. Kirkorian said, between the promise of safety for a parent and allowing independence for a child. My friend said he feels less stress since getting his daughter that Gizmo.

I owed the government money last year for the first time, and it appears that I do again. What happened?\n\nAfter the 2017 tax law took effect, tax rates generally decreased. So when the government told employers how to tweak the amount of tax they withheld from workers\u2019 paychecks, it mostly suggested decreases, and sometimes filers didn\u2019t withhold enough. If you found yourself in that situation last year \u2014 and you didn\u2019t update your withholdings \u2014 it is likely to happen again.\n\nBut the new law wasn\u2019t the only possible reason.

The rules that require minimum withdrawals from retirement accounts changed. How does this affect me?\n\nUntil this year, people were generally required to begin withdrawing money from their tax-advantaged retirement accounts when they turned 70\u00bd. Now, those who can afford to leave the money untouched can let it sit in those accounts until they are 72. That change came at the end of last year, when legislation called the Secure Act was attached to a much larger spending bill that became law.\n\nWhat does this mean in practice? If you turned 70\u00bd in 2019, the old rules still apply. That means you have until April 1 to take a required minimum distribution \u2014 otherwise you may face a stiff penalty.\n\nBut if you reach age 70\u00bd this year or later, you aren\u2019t required to withdraw money right away \u2014 you have until April 1 of the year after you reach 72.\n\nKeep in mind that these rules generally apply to employer-sponsored retirement plans as well as traditional individual retirement accounts (but not Roth I.R.A.s, at least while the account owner is still alive).

Many of the industry\u2019s most prominent start-up \u201cunicorns,\u201d including Uber, Airbnb and WeWork, have long boasted that they were born in the recession of 2008-09.

Should you use this time to tell her about your husband, or your two dogs? Or is she asking you to tell her about where you\u2019ve worked, your skills and qualifications?\n\nThe truth is, it varies. Most interviewers don\u2019t think much about this question, using it solely as a tool to get you talking. And while some may be trying to gain information, it\u2019s not really about what you say, it\u2019s how you say it. They might be looking at your communication skills, for example.

Masterman\n\n\u201cGoodness\u201d is a spectrum.\n\nOne concept I would like to bring to the table is that I do not believe in the black and white idea of an individual either being a good person or a bad person. Goodness should be thought of as a spectrum, with good and bad as extremes on either end, and individuals\u2019 goodness falls within the scale. The four insights of goodness mentioned at the end of the article are all characteristics of a good person; although, what makes an individual \u201cgood\u201d is entirely subjective to that very individual and those who witness their behavior. People are nurtured throughout their life to understand how to be a good person and how to perceive a good person. Because no individual shares the same perspective, these ideas of \u201cgood\u201d people are nuanced from person to person.\n\n\u2014 Jae Thomas, Bryant High School, Arkansas\n\nTo me, goodness does not have one set meaning. It involves caring for yourself, others, the space around you all at the same time. It means promoting a sense of well-being by doing what you believe is right. This can all be very difficult when you have conflicting information, obstacles in the way, or a tough decision to make, but all the tips in the article have a part in choosing what you think is right. I think that step 1 to being a good person starts with being kind to yourself. This means that you are optimistic about what you do, caring for yourself by thinking positive thoughts, being nutritious, and identifying what makes you happy. If you are kind to yourself, the chances are higher that you will be kinder to others, becoming more thoughtful about the present time and considering how you are making an impact in shaping the future.\n\n\u2014 MC, Masterman\n\nI feel that it\u2019s not just one factor or one part of a human that determines whether or not they\u2019re a good person at heart, but rather a serious of parts bonded together that make them who they are. People make mistakes, have bad days, and aren\u2019t nice at every single moment. This by no means makes someone a bad person. It just makes them a human being.

Does it make a difference if you have to read a poem for school rather than for pleasure? Do you ever seek out poems on your own or share poems on social media?\n\nIn \u201cHow Poetry Shakes Up the National Desk\u2019s Morning Meetings,\u201d Marc Lacey writes about a new tradition to read a poem at the beginning of meetings:\n\nWhen the National desk gets together to discuss stories, it can be a grim half-hour. We dissect natural disasters. We reconstruct mass shootings. We delve into political scandals and all manner of domestic tumult. Recently, though, we added a new feature to our morning meetings aimed at inspiring us and boosting our creativity before we embark on another long day of editing the news. We read a poem. I got the idea from an unlikely source: my son\u2019s high school English teacher, Anne Baney. During parent-teacher night, she explained how she reads a poem at the beginning of every class from \u201cPoetry 180,\u201d an anthology of contemporary poems compiled by Billy Collins, the former poet laureate of the United States. The room turns quiet when she reads, she told us. If she ever forgets to start off the day with a poem, her students remind her. They like it. And, it turns out, so do we. While there was some initial eye rolling when I first suggested the idea, Morrigan McCarthy, a photo editor and former poetry major, got it. She started us off with a poem called \u201cThe Book of Hand Shadows,\u201d by Marianne Boruch. It began like this: An eagle and a squirrel. A bull and a sage.\n\nAll take two hands, even the sheep\n\nwhose mouth is a lever for nothing, neither\n\ngrass nor complaint. The black swan\u2019s\n\nmostly one long arm, bent\n\nat the elbow but there\u2019s always feathers\n\nto fool with. \u201cThe magic of poetry,\u201d Morrigan remarked, \u201cis that it jolts your mind into thinking about a subject or theme in an unexpected way. That\u2019s exactly what we want to be doing on the National desk: looking every day for smart and interesting ways to tackle the most important stories in this country.\u201d\n\nThe article continues:\n\nEach new day brings a fresh jolt. Lauretta Charlton, the editor of Race/Related, our team covering race and identity, chose Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cThe World Is Too Much With Us\u201d: The world is too much with us; late and soon,\n\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers;\u2014\n\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\n\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! Just the other day, I took the editors to Harlem through Langston Hughes\u2019s poem by that name: What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up\n\nlike a raisin in the sun?\n\nOr fester like a sore \u2014\n\nAnd then run?\n\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\n\nOr crust and sugar over \u2014\n\nlike a syrupy sweet? To leaven the mood on a Friday, Julie Bloom, a deputy National editor, read a poem about a runaway bagel (\u201cThe Bagel,\u201d by David Ignatow): Faster and faster it rolled,\n\nwith me running after it\n\nbent low, gritting my teeth,\n\nand I found myself doubled over\n\nand rolling down the street\n\nhead over heels, one complete somersault\n\nafter another like a bagel\n\nand strangely happy with myself.\n\nThe playwright Sarah Ruhl wrote an Opinion piece reflecting on Broadway theaters closing because of the coronavirus outbreak, \u201cBroadway Is Closed. Write Poems Instead.\u201d She writes:\n\nDuring the 1590s plague, when the theaters were shut, William Shakespeare apparently chose to write poems instead. From his \u201cVenus and Adonis,\u201d penned while the playhouses were closed and writers were essentially quarantined, came this somewhat strange compliment: \u201cThe plague is banished by thy breath.\u201d Should we theater people \u2014 writers, players and audiences alike \u2014 be staying home now and writing and reading poetry as a curative for the next month? Books, unlike group events, carry no germs. My own children\u2019s school has closed indefinitely, and I\u2019ve been encouraging them to learn a new poetic form every day they are at home. So far, only my son has written a sonnet, an ode to candy. The final couplet: \u201cNow I must eat you with a splendid grace/Remember how I put you in my solemn face.\u201d But they all just looked at me with raised eyebrows when I mentioned a villanelle.\n\nStudents, read the entire article, then tell us:\n\nHow do you know if you like a poem? Does it make you feel certain emotions? Does it make you think about things differently in your life or in the world? Or, do you prefer silly or ironic poems that make you laugh?\n\nWhat is one of your favorite poems? How did you discover this poem? Did someone share it with you? What emotions, images or thoughts does this poem bring up for you? If you choose to share the poem in the comments, be sure to include the poet\u2019s name and why the poem is meaningful to you.\n\nIn the past several years, there are more poets who have become popular on social media, such as Rupi Kaur, who posts poems to Instagram.

How do you think online poetry has changed the art form of poetry?\n\nHow do you think poems can inspire us or change the way we view the world?

Neighborhood volunteers in bright orange vests patrol the entrance to our apartment compounds, stopping nonresidents from entering, and reminding everyone to stay indoors and to wear masks if they go out. The streets are almost empty, many businesses are closed and few cars are on the road.

Brokers, buyers and sellers are struggling mightily to do business when it\u2019s anything but business as usual. Open houses are being eliminated, or at least circumscribed; brokers are doing FaceTime apartment tours for clients who are worried about being out. And, in the suburbs, they\u2019re scrambling to find short term rentals for clients who feel the walls and everything else closing in on them in the city.\n\nGetting Buyers into Your Home\n\nRestrictions on open houses now range from limits on frequency and duration, to required preregistration to full-on bans in some buildings. Prospective buyers should be prepared to swap their shoes for booties before they start counting closets and to keep their (sanitized) hands to themselves.\n\nEven a week ago, before many businesses and schools closed, a survey by the National Association of Realtors found that 25 percent of sellers nationwide had already changed the terms of engagement with prospective buyers because of the virus. New requirements include a stop at a hand-washing station, at the very least, a liberal spritz of hand sanitizer. In some instances, buyers are being asked to leave their shoes at the door and don booties. And they\u2019re often discouraged from touching kitchen and bathroom fixtures.\n\nDenae Montesi, a sales agent at William Raveis NYC, is punctilious about being the one to open and close the front door. She keeps as firm a grip on her iPad as she does on the doorknob, signing in prospective buyers at open houses rather than letting them do it themselves. Other brokers have chosen to go old school: they provide pens, wiping them down after each use, or simply invite attendees to keep them.", "The ban, which would initially be for 30 days, would not restrict travel between E.U. member states, but 10 European countries have already introduced their own border controls.\n\nFrance imposed a 15-day lockdown on its citizens, with President Emmanuel Macron saying in a speech on Monday: \u201cWe are at war.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just national borders. Europeans are erecting boundaries inside their cities and neighborhoods and around their homes. A life of \u201cbumping shoulders on the street or in the cafe, greeting friends with kisses on the cheeks\u201d is no more, writes our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe.\n\nHere are the latest updates on the outbreak and maps of where the virus has spread.\n\nElsewhere around the world:\n\nPresident President Trump and U.S. health officials advised against gatherings of more than 10 people and discouraged young people in particular from going to bars and restaurants. Millions of people in the San Francisco area were ordered to \u201cshelter in place.\u201d\n\nCanada closed its borders to most foreign travelers.\n\nIn a reversal, British prime minister Boris Johnson said people should work at home and avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, but stopped short of ordering schools or businesses closed.\n\nPresident Trump told a group of governors they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators for severe coronavirus cases.\n\nAcross the Middle East, schools, malls, restaurants and workplaces were shuttered and flights were suspended as countries like Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Kuwait moved aggressively to deal with the outbreak.\n\nWhat to know: Social isolation doesn\u2019t have to be lonely. Also, if your kids are learning from home, maybe our writing prompts will help.\n\nThe Times is providing free access to much of our coverage, and our Coronavirus Briefing newsletter \u2014 like all of our newsletters \u2014 is free.", "But unlike in L.A., residents of the affected counties will also be mostly barred from leaving home except for \u201cessential\u201d activities and travel.\n\nWhat does that all mean? Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nHow many people are affected?\n\nThe counties that ordered residents to shelter in place have a combined population of roughly 7 million. For comparison, Los Angeles County has about 10 million residents, as we mentioned above, and Orange County\u2019s population is about 3 million.\n\nBut the Bay Area counties have been among the hardest hit by the virus, with more than 273 confirmed cases and four deaths attributed to the virus.\n\nAnd how long will this last?\n\nThe order went into effect at 12:01 a.m. It\u2019s set to last until April 7, but officials could extend or shorten that time.\n\nI get that I\u2019m supposed to stay home and most businesses are supposed to close but can I still \u2026\n\nGo to work? Not unless you work for what\u2019s considered an essential business or service provider. (More on that below.) You\u2019re also not supposed to travel \u2014 including \u201con foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile or public transit\u201d \u2014 unless it\u2019s to do one of those essential things. Of course, if you\u2019re already working from home, then that\u2019ll probably continue.\n\nGo outside? Yes, but only if you can stay at least six feet away from any people you don\u2019t live with. That applies to shared outdoor space, say, at your apartment complex, and parks.\n\nGo to restaurants? No, except for takeout. Restaurants are considered essential businesses and officials are encouraging them to stay open, but only for pick up or delivery. If you can, call your favorite local restaurant to see what steps they\u2019re taking. (Here in L.A., there are restaurants offering pickup specials or adding extra provisions to their menus.) Schools that feed students are also supposed to send the food home with them.\n\nHang out with friends at their houses or at my house? Alas, not really. The order says that, \u201call public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single household or living unit are prohibited,\u201d and that any time you leave your house, even for essential reasons, you should be able to stay at least six feet away from others.\n\nAre there exceptions to all this?", "On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against any gatherings of 50 or more people over the next eight weeks, in an effort to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Many public schools, libraries, universities, places of worship, and sporting and cultural institutions have also shut down for at least the next few weeks. These measures are an attempt to enforce distance between people, a proven way to slow pandemics.\n\nExperts have also been urging people to practice voluntary \u201csocial distancing.\u201d The term has been trending on Twitter, with even President Trump endorsing it on Saturday.\n\nStill, people all over the United States have been out in large numbers at restaurants, bars and even sporting events, suggesting more than a little confusion around what social distancing is and who should be practicing it.\n\nThis is deeply worrying, experts said, because even those who become only mildly ill \u2014 and maybe even those who never even know they are infected \u2014 can propel the exponential movement of the virus through the population.", "\u201cIt started for me with a pretty severe sore throat.\u201d \u201cI started to feel symptomatic five days after traveling.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s different than the bronchitis that I\u2019ve gotten before.\u201d \u201cEverything had kind of settled in my lungs. And I was just coughing a ton.\u201d \u201cI had a headache and felt feverish.\u201d \u201cIt felt like I had a bowling ball on my chest. Nobody\u2019s willing to see me, and nobody has the test kit and even C.D.C. is refusing to test me.\u201d \u201cI traced back, you know, my wife, she works at Amazon. They had a confirmed case.\u201d \u201cFour different planes in four different airports. So I don\u2019t know who sat next to me or who I was in contact with.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going down, not up. We\u2019re going very substantially down. Not up.\u201d \u201cAnybody that needs a test, gets a test. They\u2019re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.\u201d \u201cWe have a president saying anyone who wants tests can get a test. And I\u2019m thinking, That is so not true.\u201d \u201cIt was just interesting, because there was this kind of gray area for a while of people who felt like they were really sick and should have been tested just as, even as a rule out. And the state of Washington just did not have the capacity to do that, because the government had not supported us at that point essentially.\u201d \u201cI got through to public health after about an hour, and they told me that I did not meet the criteria for being tested.\u201d \u201cThey said, \u2018There\u2019s no way to get tested. We don\u2019t have tests right now. There\u2019s nothing set up in Delaware.\u2019\u201d \u201cI looked at the C.D.C. website and it said, call your doctor if you have the symptoms. So I called the doctor\u2019s office and they told me to go to an urgent care facility. I called an urgent care facility and they said that there\u2019s nothing that they can do. And they don\u2019t have the tests. And they told me to go to the E.R. And I called a hospital, and they told me that they don\u2019t have the test either.\u201d \u201cI just felt like I was getting the run-around. It was clearly obvious that they just are under capacity, and they\u2019re not able to test.\u201d \u201cI eventually just gave up because, at that point, the testing criteria was so strict. It was, you travel to China or have you been in contact with someone known diagnosed Covid. And I didn\u2019t meet any of that.\u201d \u201cAs a nurse in an E.R., it\u2019s pretty vital if I have an infectious disease that I know what it is because I could be spreading it to people who are really vulnerable.\u201d \u201cI actually work in a building that\u2019s a fairly public place. There\u2019s people of every generation coming in there. There\u2019s a private school there. There\u2019s a senior center.\u201d \u201cSouthwest Florida is full of elders. There is a lot of snowbirds coming here. They\u2019re all in their 70s and 80s. I cannot get myself, like I cannot convince my conscience to leave the house just thinking about that, Hey you went grocery shopping and now like five people died. So I just self quarantined myself and basically started working from home.\u201d \u201cWe stocked up on food items as much as possible. I bought a 25 pound bag of rice. We bought beans. We got ready basically just to hunker down for those two weeks. At this point, I\u2019m telling people like make \u2014 if you have a decision to make, think about survival and make the decision based on survival for yourself, your family and your community.\u201d \u201cWe knew this was coming. The federal government is just completely bungling this, and our lives are at stake. I feel like they\u2019re just leaving us here to die in Seattle.\u201d \u201cThe most overwhelming feeling was you are on your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just really concerned for those that this is going to affect the hardest. And I think we pretty much failed at early testing, early containment. We had more time than other governments.\u201d", "To the Editor:\n\nFor years many businesses large and small have closed because of the large rent increases foisted upon them by landlords. Now we are faced with an even more dire situation as a result of the coronavirus: lack of patronage.\n\nLandlords should suspend or mitigate rent payments, or make arrangements for future payments. That way these establishments may survive, their employees granted a reprieve from layoff or, in many cases, the loss of their jobs. And those who frequent these establishments should order takeout and have their food or merchandise delivered.\n\nThis is the time to pull together and save what is precious. If we do not do so, the panic will continue, and the recession predicted by many, avoidable if sense prevails, will surely come.\n\nRichard M. Frauenglass\n\nHuntington, N.Y.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cFed Cuts Rates to Near Zero; Virus Toll Soars\u201d (front page, March 16):\n\nNow that financial institutions can borrow money at no interest (or close to it), why can\u2019t the Fed cap their unsecured lending rate at, say, 5 percent for the duration? This would be a huge boon to the millions of people who will struggle to pay off credit cards and consumer loans when they lose their jobs. And it might stave off a tsunami of bankruptcies."], "20200317": ["Find all our Student Opinion questions here.\n\nIn \u201cWe Need Social Solidarity, Not Just Social Distancing,\u201d Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist, writes that to combat the coronavirus, Americans need to do more than secure their own safety:\n\nSocial distancing \u2014 canceling large gatherings, closing schools and offices, quarantining individuals and even sequestering entire cities or neighborhoods \u2014 seems to be the best way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But it\u2019s a crude and costly public health strategy. Shuttering shared spaces and institutions means families lose child care, wages and social support. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s insufficient to protect the older, sick, homeless and isolated people who are most vulnerable to the virus. They need extra care and attention to survive, not society\u2019s back. \u2026 In addition to social distancing, societies have often drawn on another resource to survive disasters and pandemics: social solidarity, or the interdependence between individuals and across groups. This is an essential tool for combating infectious diseases and other collective threats. Solidarity motivates us to promote public health, not just our own personal security. It keeps us from hoarding medicine, toughing out a cold in the workplace or sending a sick child to school. It compels us to let a ship of stranded people dock in our safe harbors, to knock on our older neighbor\u2019s door.\n\nDo you agree? In this time of fear and anxiety, do we need more solidarity? Do we all need to find ways to protect the older, sick, homeless and isolated people who are most vulnerable to the virus?\n\nWhat can you and your friends, family and community do to look out for one another?\n\nIn \u201c\u2018People Need Immediate Relief,\u2019 and Online Donors Make It Happen,\u201d Nicholas Kulish writes about how outpourings of generosity on social media during the coronavirus pandemic are part of a shift toward direct giving:\n\nShortly before midnight on Thursday, the author Shea Serrano was at his home in San Antonio, lying comfortably on his sofa watching television. He could not shake a bad feeling about all the low-wage and hourly workers losing desperately needed tips and shifts because of the coronavirus outbreak. He felt he needed to do something. So he tweeted. What for many would be a futile act \u2014 venting into an endless stream of chatter, jokes and invective \u2014 meant, for Mr. Serrano, activating his dedicated following of 345,000 Twitter users. By Sunday night he had raised $10,000 \u2014 not for a traditional charity like the Red Cross but to send directly to people who posted screenshots of student-loan statements and past-due medical bills. Mr. Serrano\u2019s tweet (which contained an obscenity) asked \u201cwho has a bill coming up that they\u2019re not sure they\u2019re gonna be able to pay,\u201d then requested a copy of the bill and a Venmo connection. It has been retweeted nearly 10,000 times. \u201cI knew as soon as they started closing stuff down, we were going to do something,\u201d Mr. Serrano, who published a 2015 best seller, \u201cThe Rap Year Book,\u201d said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m acutely aware what it means if someone loses even one shift. If you\u2019re making $7 an hour and you\u2019re not going to get $56, that screws up a lot of stuff.\u201d His feed quickly turned into a collective outpouring of stories about chronic illnesses and looming debt burdens. Mr. Serrano accepted some donors\u2019 money and redistributed it to those in need; many of his followers sent money directly to complete strangers, using mobile payment systems like Venmo and PayPal. As the Twitter user JCSourWine put it after helping an expectant father with his car payment, \u201cAll we got is each other.\u201d\n\nRia Misra provides more practical ways to make a difference in the lives of others in the Wirecutter article \u201c5 Ways to Help Your Community Combat Coronavirus (While Still Social Distancing).\u201d Here are excerpts from three recommendations:\n\nDonate to your local food bank As the virus spreads, food banks could face additional pressures. David May, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, said that the group currently distributes 1 million pounds of food per week. But Mr. May noted that it was also preparing for the possibility of increased demand in case of virus-driven school closings or an influx of workers struggling to get by on fewer hours than usual. When donating to your local food bank, consider starting with your wallet instead of your pantry. Donating money not only gives food banks flexibility over which supplies \u2014 including fresh foods and paper products \u2014 to offer but also lets them decide when to refresh their stocks. Offer assistance to at-risk neighbors The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.) considers the elderly and people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease to be at higher risk from the coronavirus. If you\u2019re in a lower-risk group, reach out to your higher-risk neighbors and community members and ask them how you can help, whether by picking up prescriptions and groceries or offering other assistance. Even if they\u2019re already fully stocked, simply sharing your plans with one another can be helpful, particularly as people spend more time at home instead of out. \u201cIt can be very isolating for individuals if they\u2019re staying away from the places they normally go,\u201d Herman Schaffer, the assistant commissioner for community outreach for the New York City Emergency Management Department, told me. \u201cSome assistance is also just community, being able to talk to someone, and connect to information.\u201d Plan to stay in touch from afar As Covid-19 spreads, we\u2019ll continue to see more people asked to work remotely or from home, more school closings, more canceled events, and other measures associated with social distancing. Start putting a plan in place now for how you\u2019ll stay in touch with loved ones, friends, classmates, and co-workers, even when you\u2019re not physically seeing them. (And if you need help setting up to work from home, we have several recommendations.) If the idea of a day of back-to-back Google hangouts and phone calls is adding to instead of relieving your anxieties, remember that there are a lot of ways beyond a call or a video chat to keep in contact. I like to challenge distant friends to virtual matches on a chess app and to share the occasional photo from my day via group text. Scheduling an hour to game online with a friend or swapping recipes in your group chat are small measures, but they let people know that you\u2019re thinking about them, even when you don\u2019t see them.\n\nStudents, read ONE of the articles in its entirety, then tell us:", "Find all our Student Opinion questions here.\n\nHow do you feel when you read a poem? Does it make a difference if you have to read a poem for school rather than for pleasure? Do you ever seek out poems on your own or share poems on social media?\n\nIn \u201cHow Poetry Shakes Up the National Desk\u2019s Morning Meetings,\u201d Marc Lacey writes about a new tradition to read a poem at the beginning of meetings:\n\nWhen the National desk gets together to discuss stories, it can be a grim half-hour. We dissect natural disasters. We reconstruct mass shootings. We delve into political scandals and all manner of domestic tumult. Recently, though, we added a new feature to our morning meetings aimed at inspiring us and boosting our creativity before we embark on another long day of editing the news. We read a poem. I got the idea from an unlikely source: my son\u2019s high school English teacher, Anne Baney. During parent-teacher night, she explained how she reads a poem at the beginning of every class from \u201cPoetry 180,\u201d an anthology of contemporary poems compiled by Billy Collins, the former poet laureate of the United States. The room turns quiet when she reads, she told us. If she ever forgets to start off the day with a poem, her students remind her. They like it. And, it turns out, so do we. While there was some initial eye rolling when I first suggested the idea, Morrigan McCarthy, a photo editor and former poetry major, got it. She started us off with a poem called \u201cThe Book of Hand Shadows,\u201d by Marianne Boruch. It began like this: An eagle and a squirrel. A bull and a sage.\n\nAll take two hands, even the sheep\n\nwhose mouth is a lever for nothing, neither\n\ngrass nor complaint. The black swan\u2019s\n\nmostly one long arm, bent\n\nat the elbow but there\u2019s always feathers\n\nto fool with. \u201cThe magic of poetry,\u201d Morrigan remarked, \u201cis that it jolts your mind into thinking about a subject or theme in an unexpected way. That\u2019s exactly what we want to be doing on the National desk: looking every day for smart and interesting ways to tackle the most important stories in this country.\u201d\n\nThe article continues:\n\nEach new day brings a fresh jolt. Lauretta Charlton, the editor of Race/Related, our team covering race and identity, chose Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cThe World Is Too Much With Us\u201d: The world is too much with us; late and soon,\n\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers;\u2014\n\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\n\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! Just the other day, I took the editors to Harlem through Langston Hughes\u2019s poem by that name: What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up\n\nlike a raisin in the sun?\n\nOr fester like a sore \u2014\n\nAnd then run?\n\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?\n\nOr crust and sugar over \u2014\n\nlike a syrupy sweet? To leaven the mood on a Friday, Julie Bloom, a deputy National editor, read a poem about a runaway bagel (\u201cThe Bagel,\u201d by David Ignatow): Faster and faster it rolled,\n\nwith me running after it\n\nbent low, gritting my teeth,\n\nand I found myself doubled over\n\nand rolling down the street\n\nhead over heels, one complete somersault\n\nafter another like a bagel\n\nand strangely happy with myself.\n\nThe playwright Sarah Ruhl wrote an Opinion piece reflecting on Broadway theaters closing because of the coronavirus outbreak, \u201cBroadway Is Closed. Write Poems Instead.\u201d She writes:\n\nDuring the 1590s plague, when the theaters were shut, William Shakespeare apparently chose to write poems instead. From his \u201cVenus and Adonis,\u201d penned while the playhouses were closed and writers were essentially quarantined, came this somewhat strange compliment: \u201cThe plague is banished by thy breath.\u201d Should we theater people \u2014 writers, players and audiences alike \u2014 be staying home now and writing and reading poetry as a curative for the next month? Books, unlike group events, carry no germs. My own children\u2019s school has closed indefinitely, and I\u2019ve been encouraging them to learn a new poetic form every day they are at home. So far, only my son has written a sonnet, an ode to candy. The final couplet: \u201cNow I must eat you with a splendid grace/Remember how I put you in my solemn face.\u201d But they all just looked at me with raised eyebrows when I mentioned a villanelle.\n\nStudents, read the entire article, then tell us:\n\nHow do you know if you like a poem? Does it make you feel certain emotions? Does it make you think about things differently in your life or in the world? Or, do you prefer silly or ironic poems that make you laugh?\n\nWhat is one of your favorite poems? How did you discover this poem? Did someone share it with you? What emotions, images or thoughts does this poem bring up for you? If you choose to share the poem in the comments, be sure to include the poet\u2019s name and why the poem is meaningful to you.\n\nIn the past several years, there are more poets who have become popular on social media, such as Rupi Kaur, who posts poems to Instagram. Do you think that poems published on the internet are more accessible or interesting for readers? How do you think online poetry has changed the art form of poetry?\n\nHow do you think poems can inspire us or change the way we view the world? When you experience hardship or pain, do you ever turn to poetry? Are there other art forms or creative expression that you seek out or create in difficult moments?\n\nDo you ever write poems?

They listened to pop music and traded jokes. When the group broke out into \u201cHappy Birthday to You,\u201d Eleanor pulled a slice of cookie cheesecake close in front of her and pretended to blow out the toothpick she had substituted for a candle on top.\n\nThen, she blew lightly on her computer screen.

As leaders of three institutions fortunate to have access to outstanding public health research, we quickly came to understand in recent weeks that if we wanted to help protect the health of our nation, we had to take drastic action.\n\nExperts advised us that to slow the spread of the virus, we must reduce population density and increase social distancing on our campuses. That meant turning university life upside down: suddenly sending virtually all of our undergraduates home; asking faculty to swiftly bring all instruction online; canceling academic, athletic, artistic and cultural events, and nearly all in-person meetings; shutting our libraries; and asking everyone who could work remotely to do so right away.\n\nInitially, these actions felt awful, and uncomfortably extreme \u2014 even to those of us in charge. And the practical consequences have been difficult for everyone.\n\nSo, is all this disruption really necessary?\n\nWe believe the answer is yes.\n\nThe experience of other countries has shown the crucial value of making big moves as quickly as possible to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d \u2014 to slow the rate of infection so that our hospitals and health care workers are not overwhelmed.", "The guidelines are not mandatory and fall short of measures taken by other countries.

Jide Zeitlin, the chief executive, called these \u201cunprecedented times.\u201d", "The coronavirus has changed the way we live our daily lives and it has upended countless business sectors, including the New York real estate market. Brokers, buyers and sellers are struggling mightily to do business when it\u2019s anything but business as usual. Open houses are being eliminated, or at least circumscribed; brokers are doing FaceTime apartment tours for clients who are worried about being out. And, in the suburbs, they\u2019re scrambling to find short term rentals for clients who feel the walls and everything else closing in on them in the city.\n\nGetting Buyers into Your Home\n\nRestrictions on open houses now range from limits on frequency and duration, to required preregistration to full-on bans in some buildings. Prospective buyers should be prepared to swap their shoes for booties before they start counting closets and to keep their (sanitized) hands to themselves.\n\nEven a week ago, before many businesses and schools closed, a survey by the National Association of Realtors found that 25 percent of sellers nationwide had already changed the terms of engagement with prospective buyers because of the virus. New requirements include a stop at a hand-washing station, at the very least, a liberal spritz of hand sanitizer. In some instances, buyers are being asked to leave their shoes at the door and don booties.

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nHow many people are affected?\n\nThe counties that ordered residents to shelter in place have a combined population of roughly 7 million. For comparison, Los Angeles County has about 10 million residents, as we mentioned above, and Orange County\u2019s population is about 3 million.\n\nBut the Bay Area counties have been among the hardest hit by the virus, with more than 273 confirmed cases and four deaths attributed to the virus.\n\nAnd how long will this last?\n\nThe order went into effect at 12:01 a.m. It\u2019s set to last until April 7, but officials could extend or shorten that time.\n\nI get that I\u2019m supposed to stay home and most businesses are supposed to close but can I still \u2026\n\nGo to work?

You\u2019re also not supposed to travel \u2014 including \u201con foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile or public transit\u201d \u2014 unless it\u2019s to do one of those essential things. Of course, if you\u2019re already working from home, then that\u2019ll probably continue.\n\nGo outside? Yes, but only if you can stay at least six feet away from any people you don\u2019t live with. That applies to shared outdoor space, say, at your apartment complex, and parks.\n\nGo to restaurants? No, except for takeout. Restaurants are considered essential businesses and officials are encouraging them to stay open, but only for pick up or delivery. If you can, call your favorite local restaurant to see what steps they\u2019re taking. (Here in L.A., there are restaurants offering pickup specials or adding extra provisions to their menus.) Schools that feed students are also supposed to send the food home with them.\n\nHang out with friends at their houses or at my house? Alas, not really. The order says that, \u201call public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single household or living unit are prohibited,\u201d and that any time you leave your house, even for essential reasons, you should be able to stay at least six feet away from others.\n\nAre there exceptions to all this?", "\u201cThe reality is there is absolutely not enough,\u201d said Andreas Wieland, the chief executive of Hamilton Medical in Switzerland, a leading ventilator maker.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThere are about 160,000 ventilators in U.S. hospitals, with another 12,700 in a stockpile the federal government keeps for national emergencies.\n\nA new machine can cost up to $50,000 . Fewer than a dozen American companies make them; about half of those used in the U.S. are imported.\n\nOne Italian company quadrupled its output, making up to 150 ventilators a week, with help from engineers and other workers from the Ministry of Defense.\n\nBritain expects to need many more than the 5,000 ventilators it has. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is calling on carmakers to start making them.\n\nMore shortages: In the U.S., detecting the disease is hampered by extremely short supplies of swabs and protective gear. The special swabs needed for testing come mainly from an Italian company that is working around the clock.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law allowing him to order American factories to boost production of critical supplies like ventilators and masks.\n\nA dangerous side effect for older people: loneliness\n\nPeople over 60 are at elevated risk of serious illness from the coronavirus, and it\u2019s even more severe for people over 80. So older people have to be especially cautious \u2014 which can mean cutting off from family, friends and communities.\n\n\u201cIt is a terrible irony of the virus that, for older adults, steps to prevent the spread of Covid-19 increase the risks of social isolation, which carries its own devastating health effects,\u201d our reporter John Leland writes.\n\nSince this newsletter began, we\u2019ve asked readers to tell us how they\u2019re coping with the outbreak.

As the lay-leader of our church, I have been in contact with half of the members on almost a daily basis about social distancing. It is so much easier to care about the flock than to worry about ourselves. And it helps with the isolation. We can all take the time to call someone each day and check up on them.\n\nHow to get through it: We asked the C.D.C., W.H.O. and doctors for advice.

And I\u2019m thinking, That is so not true.\u201d \u201cIt was just interesting, because there was this kind of gray area for a while of people who felt like they were really sick and should have been tested just as, even as a rule out. And the state of Washington just did not have the capacity to do that, because the government had not supported us at that point essentially.\u201d \u201cI got through to public health after about an hour, and they told me that I did not meet the criteria for being tested.\u201d \u201cThey said, \u2018There\u2019s no way to get tested.

And they don\u2019t have the tests. And they told me to go to the E.R. And I called a hospital, and they told me that they don\u2019t have the test either.\u201d \u201cI just felt like I was getting the run-around. It was clearly obvious that they just are under capacity, and they\u2019re not able to test.\u201d \u201cI eventually just gave up because, at that point, the testing criteria was so strict. It was, you travel to China or have you been in contact with someone known diagnosed Covid. And I didn\u2019t meet any of that.\u201d \u201cAs a nurse in an E.R., it\u2019s pretty vital if I have an infectious disease that I know what it is because I could be spreading it to people who are really vulnerable.\u201d \u201cI actually work in a building that\u2019s a fairly public place.

The federal government is just completely bungling this, and our lives are at stake. I feel like they\u2019re just leaving us here to die in Seattle.\u201d \u201cThe most overwhelming feeling was you are on your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just really concerned for those that this is going to affect the hardest.

Now we are faced with an even more dire situation as a result of the coronavirus: lack of patronage.\n\nLandlords should suspend or mitigate rent payments, or make arrangements for future payments. That way these establishments may survive, their employees granted a reprieve from layoff or, in many cases, the loss of their jobs.

Then Nick Kokonas, its founder and chief executive, got a call from Brian Canlis, an owner of the restaurant Canlis in Seattle.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, we need to do a pickup meal and I\u2019m not sure I can properly configure enough of them as \u2018tables,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kokonas recalled in an email. \u201cHe was trying to \u2018hack\u2019 the existing system, which is very powerful for normal restaurants but was not geared to carryout inventory.\u201d\n\nTock wrote some new software so restaurants could sell meals online and, crucially, process credit card payments, which requires an ability to encrypt data that most restaurants do not possess. About 40 restaurants in the United States and several in other countries have started using the new service, Tock to Go.\n\nBy Sunday, a competing reservations service, Resy, which like Tock was watching the numbers of bookings on its site crash in one city after another, had also repurposed its site for delivery and pickup orders. About 30 restaurants have signed on. (Resy has waived its fees to restaurants for at least 30 days. Tock is collecting its monthly fee.)\n\nRestaurants are the main clients for many other businesses, from florists to linen services to farms, that have lost income as people have been ordered to stay home. Few of them are as nimble, though, as the technology-driven reservation services, and even they are uncertain how many of the to-go operations that were put together over the past few days will still be running next week.", "I bought cough syrup and children\u2019s Tylenol.\n\nIn late February I told my therapist I was displacing my anxiety about being a single parent and our looming divorce trial onto the virus. She nodded along, agreeing that my stress was connected to my situation. But somewhere during the session, I accidentally convinced her that my anxiety was warranted. As she left, she said she needed to go shopping.\n\nI drove my family nuts with all of my worries, but I decided not to talk to my ex about it. I feared that if I tried giving him rules or even made suggestions, it could backfire.\n\nI waited. And waited. Finally, once it was clear the virus was in the New York area, and we started discussing the situation, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that we had come to the same conclusions independently. We both stopped traveling, and we agreed that if one of us started developing symptoms, we\u2019d tell the other.\n\nOne morning I found a WhatsApp message from him asking if he should send the boys to school that day. He wanted to make such a difficult decision together. I almost burst into tears from relief.\n\nWe\u2019re now on the same page about rules for the kids in terms of social distancing. No more play dates. Yes, they can go in the backyard; no, they can\u2019t go to playgrounds.

I know there are benefits to going offline and going outdoors, but I do not think I can live my entire life that way. Technology has been all around me since I was born and it is completely ingrained in my life. To go off the grid would change parts of my life, big and small. For example, some of the bigger things include: how I communicate with my friends and family, how I do homework and schoolwork, how I connect with the world and hear about current events. All these things would change.\n\n\u2014 Isabelle Ang, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL\n\nThe guilt of using my phone stemmed from conversations with my parents. They were raised in a small town in India during the 1960s. They had no access to phones or computers. The internet did not even exist! To this day, my dad reads physical newspapers and my mom prefers to call me using the landline rather than her iPhone. They discourage the obsession of cellphones for the same reasons that Charity Warder\u2019s did: no pressure from social media, no distractions and better communication skills. Green Bank is ideal for my parents because it is the situation they grew up in. However, I grew up in a completely different time period and situation than them.

In my opinion it would be better for our mental health to not have to worry about what people are saying or posting about you, but on the other hand it would also be a lot harder to communicate with friends and family.\n\n\u2014 Soen McCormick, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC\n\nHuman connection has been lost in our generation as people become enthralled with their phone instead of enjoying the presence of life around them. At dinner, people would rather be on their phones instead of spending time with their family. I usually have to check myself when I become so attached to my phone because it is an addiction I don\u2019t want. This town has the opportunity to live in a calm society with pure connection with others that is not created with the use of a cell phone. I envy this town because with social media and the internet it can all become so loud. Sometimes quietness can benefit everyone.\n\n\u2014 Marisa Silk, Norwood High School, Norwood, MA\n\nCan someone please buy me a house in Green Bank? That kind of society is one I can only dream of, and so unlike the one I find myself ensnared in. Sometimes I find myself imagining what my life would look like if I was living in the 80s. If you\u2019ve watched movies like The Goonies or The Breakfast Club, you\u2019ve seen what kind of fun stuff they do together without their phones or social media getting in the way. I feel like it\u2019s hard for many people, myself included, to really engage one another, have adventures and hobbies in the real world, and develop meaningful relationships outside of a screen.\n\n\u2014 Grace Robertson, Hoggard High School Wilmington, NC\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to live in a quiet zone like Green Bank, because my phone is pretty important to me. I use it to chat with friends that don\u2019t live near me and I read a lot on my phone. To go on vacation in a quiet zone to get away from all the buzz of social media would be a nice experience. I would of course have to bring books to replace my phone and probably some post cards to send my friends back home. Just being in nature and not having your phone means you have to find other things to pass the time, so I\u2019d kind of have to spend the time outside exploring the countryside which I\u2019d like.\n\n\u2014 Annina, Switzerland\n\nI don\u2019t know about living somewhere as remote and quiet as Green Bank, but I think it would be cool to live out in the country on a farm, or somewhere without internet and technology access. Personally, the only reason that I care about my phone is because it allows me to communicate with my friends and family, and it can help with homework. I wouldn\u2019t miss at all it if I had to give it away, and I didn\u2019t actually want to get a phone in the first place. If I could choose how everybody handles phones and technology, I would make it so that everybody has easy access to a phone so we could take advantage of things like calling, face- time, directions, and safety.

Use gloves when you go shopping or are in public, masks if you think that it would be best for you, those who have more wiggle room financially can help out others who don\u2019t have that same wiggle room financially and who are now struggling, buy groceries for those who can\u2019t afford it or are at risk if they were to go out in public.

Social distancing is proven to help drastically, so please, social distance.\n\n\u2014 Dakodah, Camdenton, MO\n\nAs a person, we have the ability to help our friends, families, elders, people with illnesses in our community and people with high risks of getting the virus. We can accomplish this by simply observing who may need help with shopping, for groceries or clothes, with yard work, or any kind of outside work that is done where there are rooms full of people, such as going to the bank. As a younger person and a person with a low risk of getting the virus, I have the capability to walk to places and go in and out of buildings with a smaller chance of getting the virus as compared to one of my elder neighbors. My friends and I can go around the neighborhood and see who needs help during this hard time, whether I have to give them money or food to help them out.\n\n\u2014 Adrianna P, New York\n\nMany elderly people in my vicinity suffer from chronic conditions and illnesses and there are others who often live alone. Going to the grocery store or the pharmacy can also be hassle for many.

Fights are breaking out in grocery stores and this is a dangerous situation to put the elderly in.\n\n\u2014 Sydney, B\n\nIn our American society we tend to be very individualistic. This pandemic has truly proved that point as people do not care for other but themselves.

Instead of hoarding all the food share some with a neighbor or an old person that doesn\u2019t quite have the ability to run around store to store grabbing what they can.

What must hold firm when nothing seems to?\u201d\n\nBetween the Olympics being postponed, school being moved online, and sports events, weddings and graduations canceled, many people are wondering what will go on, and how?\n\nHow do you view the role of democracy and the constitutional right to vote in the midst of a pandemic? Should democratic procedures be relaxed or suspended, or is it more important to find ways to preserve them during a crisis?\n\nIn \u201cIs All of 2020 Postponed?,\u201d Matt Flegenheimer writes about the overall resistance to postponing the primaries and the 2020 presidential election:\n\n\u201cWe voted in the middle of a Civil War,\u201d Joseph R. Biden Jr., the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination, told supporters at a tele-fund-raiser on Sunday. \u201cWe voted in the middle of World War I and II. And so, the idea of postponing the electoral process is just \u2014 seems to me, out of the question.\u201d And yet for weeks, the moment has delivered one reminder after the next of all that the crisis has made wobbly, all that seemed certain before certainty went into quarantine. Dates exist in stone until they don\u2019t. Younger people are spared the worst of the virus\u2019s ravages until they aren\u2019t. American ideals, in 2020, leave no room for the concession of mass death, surely. But then here is a White House now suggesting that the cure (stifling business for a period to encourage social distancing) cannot become worse than the disease (the disease).\n\nThe article continues:\n\nAlready, meaningful electoral proceedings have been delayed or recast. Many states have pushed their primaries into June in the hopes of waiting out the worst of the virus. Pennsylvania, slated for April 28, is likely to be next. Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden\u2019s chief rival, has effectively converted his campaign into a pandemic policy shop and vessel for progressive activism as he confronts a significant delegate deficit. Planners for the Democratic National Convention said this week that they were assessing \u201ccontingency options\u201d in case the July gathering cannot go on as planned. But the general election is another matter. No one in a position of relevant authority has proposed moving it, though the subject has instantly become a cause of angst for President Trump\u2019s critics. These fears seem to owe more to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on democratic norms and institutions during his time in office than anything the president has said of late. So far, Mr. Trump has appeared inclined to defy the guidance of public health experts by suggesting Americans return to their workplaces and public engagements well before the coronavirus has been tamed. Even if he wished to delay the November election, the decision would appear to be out of his hands. Any change to the date would require federal legislation, passed by Congress, to say nothing of challenges in the court system.\n\nYou may be wondering more about the possibility of voting by mail. Read the following two excerpts from \u201cVoting by Mail Is the Hot New Idea. Is There Time to Make It Work?\u201d by Nick Corasaniti and Stephanie Saul to learn about some of the options that individual states and Congress are exploring:\n\nThe next three nominating contests in the Democratic primary race \u2014 Hawaii, Wyoming and Alaska \u2014 are all run by the state Democratic Party, not the state government. All three have had extensive vote-by-mail operations in place for months; Wyoming even canceled its in-person caucuses and went to a full vote-by-mail system. But given the decentralized structure of American elections, which are governed by states, counties and even municipalities, shifting to a federally mandated, completely vote-by-mail system for the general election could be impossible both logistically and legislatively. Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, expressed optimism that states could gear up to expand mail and absentee voting for the coming primary elections, which tend to have relatively low turnout. The November general election will be another matter, he said. \u201cI think that once people take a deep breath and consider what\u2019s going to be done in November, they\u2019re going to realize that the big lift necessary to expand the amount of mail voting by a factor of four, five or six in some states is going to be disruptive,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, who studies both voting technology and election administration. Under normal circumstances, states gradually transition to mail voting. Mr. Stewart said he worried that states\u2019 lack of experience holding big elections without in-person voting could have negative consequences.\n\nThe article discusses a bill by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota that would require states to offer a mail-in or drop-off paper ballot option if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe bill would call for all states to send prepaid, self-sealing envelopes, as well as ballot-tracking markers, to make sure that voters incurred no personal cost that would act as a barrier to voting, and to minimize any spread of the coronavirus through licking envelopes. Though the bill does not specify a price tag, a previous iteration under Mr. Wyden estimated a cost of roughly $500 million. But the bill would provide only the opportunity of vote-by-mail expansion, not fully transition the country to voting by mail. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying to get rid of all polling places by any means,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the more people we can get to vote this way, the better off this is.\u201d\n\nStudents, read the entire article \u201cIs All of 2020 Postponed?\u201d If you have additional time, you can also read \u201cVoting by Mail Is the Hot New Idea. Is There Time to Make It Work?\u201d Then respond to the questions:\n\nDo you believe there are some things that, even in the midst of a pandemic, should not be postponed or canceled? If yes, what?\n\nHow do you think individual states and the Democratic National Committee should balance the need to hold presidential primaries while also protecting people\u2019s health and safety? Should the primaries continue as planned, or be postponed or even canceled? Do you think there are safety measures that states and polling places should take when preparing for the primaries if they happen in person?\n\nOne larger concern discussed in the article is the potential of a postponed 2020 general election. Do you think this is something that should be considered? Or do you think alternate voting options should be explored? As you respond, be sure to consider some of the limitations of voting by mail, as discussed in Mr. Corasaniti and Ms. Saul\u2019s article.\n\nStudents 13 and older are invited to comment.

A company in Pennsylvania that makes uniforms for baseball teams. European luxury brands like Prada and Gucci. Across the world, clothing manufacturers are converting their workshops to produce much-needed medical equipment.\n\nThe production of ventilators and N95 respirators is particularly critical, and some deep-pocketed companies, like Apple, Facebook and Salesforce, are using their clout to source supplies. Ford, G.M. and Tesla are also tapping their supply chains and looking into building ventilators to send to hospitals. (Though admittedly, coordination among the state, local and federal governments in directing these efforts could be much better.)\n\nTech companies are donating their huge computing power to crunch data in the search for a cure.

Perfect.\u201d \u201cA-L-L-I-A, my name is Allia Phillips. I am 10 years old. I live in New York, New York. And I live in a shelter. And I love playing violin. OK, I\u2019m going to have to stand up for this. A lot of things are really happening right now, like Covid-19. [Violin playing] I\u2019ve heard that it is a very contagious virus. And when people get it, a lot of people have to go to the hospital. But some of them have to get isolated. It\u2019s changed my life because now, we don\u2019t get to go in school. My teacher told us that she didn\u2019t know if it was going to close for the whole year. Ta-da.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got blanky fuzz in your hair. Right now, me and Allia are actually living in a family shelter.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like the way you brush it. You brush it so hard. Basically, it\u2019s one room with a bathroom, and then one bed and a bunk bed. I guess, it\u2019s now my classroom, too.\u201d \u201cI got contacted by her school to go pick up her iPad device. And her iPad does not have internet. The shelter that we\u2019re in, they do not allow internet. What classroom stuff are we going to do today? Math?\u201d \u201cWell, science is already too hard. It keeps on pausing itself, just freezing.\u201d \u201cOh OK, I will look into that in a little bit.\u201d \u201cAcross the room.\u201d \u201cAnd see what\u2019s going on. I have a cellphone. We use the hot spot. I don\u2019t have a lot of data. And it\u2019s a little spotty and slow. Essentially, that\u2019s just where we\u2019ve been is puttering outside to get a better signal, hoping it gets better.\u201d \u201cA school has 17 tables in the cafeteria. Each table has 12 seats.\u201d \u201cI am worried that children are going to get left behind because they don\u2019t have their devices or they didn\u2019t have the access to the internet. Let\u2019s try that one again.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019ll probably have to redo our whole grade, and relearn everything we already know.\u201d \u201cRight now, my biggest worry for Allia would be the social interaction. My mother, who\u2019s disabled, and her service animal lives with us. So we\u2019re all in this really tiny space.\u201d \u201cYeah. I\u2019m worried about that because my grandmother, she is really old. And if she gets it or if my mother gets sick, they could get hurt. And if they both get it, who\u2019s going to take care of me that day? And then if we\u2019re all locked in the same room, how are we going to be safe?\u201d", "The pandemic could permanently alter the industry, United\u2019s chief executive, Oscar Munoz, and president, Scott Kirby, warned employees in a memo on Friday.

As a result, United is likely to have to cut its schedule even more in May and June.\n\nMr. Bastian, Delta\u2019s chief executive, thanked the 21,000 Delta workers who have volunteered to take unpaid leave, but encouraged more to join them.\n\n\u201cWhile this assistance is welcome, it\u2019s important to remember that the relief package is not a cure for the unprecedented challenges we face,\u201d Mr. Bastian said.", "With ventilators in short supply, the challenges at Elmhurst, a 545-bed public hospital in Queens, show the hardships that medical workers are facing.\n\nWatch: A video by Dr. Colleen Smith, an emergency room doctor at Elmhurst, offers an inside look. \u201cI don\u2019t have the support that I need,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: More than 200 Army medical workers from Kentucky were set to arrive in New York today to aid in the response.
