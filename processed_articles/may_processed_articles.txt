Are the airlines doomed?\n\nIt depends on whether the companies are insolvent \u2014 or illiquid.\n\nIn a traditional financial crisis, like 2008, the issue is uncertainty. Banks fail during a panic when all they might have needed to ride it out was liquidity. In this scenario, the central bank serves as a liquidity provider of last resort, bridging the bad times for solvent institutions.\n\nThis has been the Fed\u2019s approach. By pumping liquidity into the market \u2014 far more than during the 2008 crisis \u2014 the Fed has ensured that even airlines and cruise lines can secure ample funding in private markets. In addition, the carriers are getting $50 billion in federal grants and loans.\n\nBut that federal aid is not a bailout; it is an employment program. With the airlines flying at 10 percent capacity, the funds will keep some 750,000 workers employed through October, when the restrictions on layoffs expire. Essentially, the package is structured to sustain a pre-pandemic level of service.\n\nBut the aid does not take into account longer-lasting changes that threaten the industry\u2019s solvency. That was Mr. Buffett\u2019s point: \u201cThe world changed for airlines,\u201d he said. But who knows? I suspect that many people are planning trips for the fall. Tickets over Thanksgiving are still expensive (I checked). An uptick in flights within China provides some hope.\n\nIf air travel does not return to something approaching normal by October, then Mr. Buffett\u2019s decision to sell will have saved him more losses. It will also mean that the government merely postponed airlines\u2019 day of reckoning \u2014 at a price of $50 billion. In other words, what people now see as a liquidity problem would in fact be a solvency crisis. At that point, carrier valuations may fall far enough that Mr. Buffett decides to pick up the phone again.\n\n\u2018A remarkable indication of Econ 101\u2019s demise\u2019\n\nPeter Orszag, the head of Lazard\u2019s financial advisory practice and a former Obama administration budget chief, has written a punchy op-ed for Bloomberg about how the pandemic will upend long-held businesses practices. It is worth your time.", "Yet the latter two efforts might be much more helpful to rebuilding health infrastructure and trust in local governments here at home.\n\nOffscreen, too, rigid divides between domestic and international policy persist across the academy and the professions. It remains not only possible, but preferred, to get a doctorate in U.S. politics or public health without taking an \u201cinternational\u201d class \u2014 or to study \u201cinternational\u201d economics, development or politics without ever learning the U.S. system deeply enough to compare.\n\nCareer incentives are similarly bifurcated. If you want tenure or a top think tank gig in international affairs, don\u2019t spend too much time visibly thinking or writing about domestic issues. Top performers in domestic health, politics and law often had significant early-career international experience \u2014 which they talk about nostalgically when the cameras are turned off.\n\nNow, some U.S. cities and states are already working with international partners and drawing on international experience. Local leaders\u2019 international connections have been a key to their successes in sourcing medical equipment and supplies. Massachusetts is partnering with an NGO best known for its health work in Haiti, Partners in Health, to trace the contacts of everyone who tests positive for the virus.\n\nThose efforts will be central to recovery. Whether federal authorities step up or the responsibility remains local, massive amounts of equipment and supplies from abroad will be needed as plans to test everyone, offer antibody therapy and care for more sick people in isolated clinical settings come on line.\n\nOpportunities to ease the pain on other challenges abound. As parents agonize about backsliding in both education and equity, they might want to know that even much-envied national systems like South Korea\u2019s are struggling with online lesson plans, device distribution and the peculiarities of Zoom. Cities will want to know what happens when small shops reopen, as in Austria.", "The cities and counties of Wisconsin are learning from their experience in April. State officials can advise them on preparing for the pandemic, but it\u2019s the local clerks and commissioners who have to make the logistics work. In Milwaukee, the City Council responded to the chaos and disenfranchisement by passing a resolution asking Albrecht, the election director, to send Milwaukee\u2019s 300,000 registered voters an application for a mail-in ballot for November. Albrecht told me he would spend the summer overhauling operations. \u201cI\u2019m talking about all of it,\u201d he said. He has submitted a request to the Postal Service for an investigation. Many Milwaukee voters who applied for absentee ballots on two particular dates, March 22 and 23, did not receive them. \u201cOur forensic review shows we responded and sent them out,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cDid the post office mess up? We don\u2019t know.\u201d Albrecht is also making sure he has the supplies of paper for added ballots and envelopes that he needs. Finally, Albrecht said, he is concentrating on voter education. People who were accustomed to going to the polls made mistakes, like dropping ballots through the book-drop slot at the library without the certified envelope, which disqualified their votes.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the presidential primary scheduled for June 2 will be the first test of whether large numbers of people can successfully vote by mail. The Legislature last year passed a law that provides for absentee ballots for anyone who requests it without requiring an excuse. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 160,000 applications for mail-in ballots for the primary in the last week,\u201d Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar said when I spoke to her in mid-April. \u201cFor comparison, in 2016, we got 19,000 in the same period.\u201d She stressed that federal funding would be crucial for preparing for November. In the long run, voting by mail can be less expensive. Counties that adopted it in Colorado, one of five states that sends ballots by mail to every registered voter, spent less than $10 per voter in 2014 compared with about $16 per voter six years earlier. But in the present, states need help to make the switch.\n\nThree elected city commissioners are responsible for directing the logistics in Philadelphia. \u201cTo be honest, everything we were planning to do for November is on hold as we navigate through the virus,\u201d Lisa Deeley, one of the three commissioners and the commission\u2019s chairwoman, said when I called her in April. \u201cAll our focus right now is on the primary.\u201d\n\nA few days later, the National Association of Presort Mailers held a teleconference for vendors across the country that are in the niche business of printing and packaging bulk mail, including mail-in ballots. They specialize in details like ensuring that the paper for the ballots and envelopes is certified so the ink printed on it will scan correctly.\n\nOn the call, according to the news site Talking Points Memo, companies warned that they were already at capacity for November, filling orders from longtime vote-by-mail states like California and Colorado. They could expand, but they would need to buy costly equipment that takes several months to obtain, a step they would only take with orders from states and counties in hand. \u201cFor example, the machine that folds and inserts the ballot into the envelope can cost up to $1 million,\u201d Richard Gebbie, chief executive of Midwest Presort Mailing Services and president of the national association, told me. \u201cIt normally takes 90 days to order one piece of gear. Then you have to get it installed and check everything, because the security and quality control has to be very, very high.\u201d Gebbie\u2019s company has been contacting county boards of election in the region, including in Pennsylvania, but he says so far it has received a cool response. \u201cI think with the Covid, they\u2019re not sure what they can do. We have one county in Pennsylvania, Mercer, that said, Let\u2019s get a quote. The others said, Call us back in a month. The Catch-22 is: That could be too late.\u201d\n\nDeeley called me back later in April to assure me that Philadelphia would be ready for the fall election but gave few specifics. \u201cHer heart is in the right place, but this is just a huge challenge,\u201d says David Thornburgh, the president and C.E.O. of the Committee of Seventy, a good-government group in Philadelphia founded in 1904. \u201cWe are at the house-is-burning level of alarm in some cities,\u201d says another voting rights advocate, who didn\u2019t want to be identified criticizing local election officials. As of the end of April, Philadelphia had a backlog of almost 9,000 absentee applications waiting to be processed for the June primary. Voting rights advocates have filed a lawsuit asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to require the state to let all absentee ballots sent or postmarked by Election Day in June and November to be counted if they are received within seven days of each election.\n\nIn Michigan, where voters passed a 2018 referendum that allows voting by mail without an excuse, a big increase is also expected. \u201cWe are planning for 70 to 90 percent voting by mail in Detroit,\u201d Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who lives in the city, told me. \u201cThat means allocating resources, ordering supplies, developing educational materials.\u201d", "\u2018For as long as I can remember, books have been important to me\u2019\n\nI\u2019m an editor at Rizzoli Publications and have been working from home, like so many others.

Now, I find that my conscience is just fine with my spending more since it benefits writers who need this financial assist.

With inter-library loans shut down, the library staff have been loaning out the hard copy books on-hand, using curbside pickup as well as processing e-book requests. Secondly, they\u2019ve been processing new library card requests, which have spiked since the stay-at-home orders were issued. Finally, the staff has been calling elderly members (this is a small community) to see how they are doing, to make conversation, to drop off any food or household items they need. My wife has sewed many face masks and delivered those as well, usually with a disinfected book or two. I realize that public libraries are at the bottom of the book chain, but the people who run them are just as passionate about books, and the people who rely on them, as anyone else.\n\nSean Kelly\n\nWest Greenwich, Rhode Island\n\n\u2018Keep up the good work of pushing books!\u2019\n\nI do appreciate your plea to buy books. I myself have purchased five or six from Barnes and Noble and from one local survivor across town in the past week. My library is closed and my book clubs are not meeting in person. One book I bought is by a local author who had planned a book tour. Now she can\u2019t even have a signing at the local store! So please, keep up the good work of pushing books!", "Indiana, Kansas and Nebraska were among the states that allowed the reopening of some businesses on Monday even though they were seeing increasing cases, according to a New York Times database. Other states that have partly reopened while cases have continued to rise include Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee and Texas, according to the data.\n\nAbout half of all states have now begun reopening their economies in some significant way, which public health experts have warned could lead to a new wave of cases and deaths.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Americans have not been exposed to the virus, there is not immunity, and the initial conditions that allowed this virus to spread really quickly across America haven\u2019t really changed,\u201d said Dr. Larry Chang, an infectious-diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWhile the country has stabilized, it has not really improved, as shown by data collected by The Times. Case and death numbers remain on a numbing, tragic plateau that is tilting only slightly downward.\n\nAt least 1,000 people with the virus, and sometimes more than 2,000, have died every day for the last month. On a near daily basis, at least 25,000 new cases of the virus are being identified across the country.\n\nAnd even as New York City, New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement, other urban centers, including Chicago and Los Angeles, are reporting steady growth in the number of cases.\n\nThe situation has devolved most significantly in parts of rural America that were largely spared in the early stages of the pandemic.

Many people in Guayaquil blame the government for failing to slow the spread of coronavirus, and to deal with the thousands of bodies that have piled up in the aftermath. Guayaquil has suffered arguably the worst Covid death toll in Latin America. The thing is, Ecuador had acted earlier than its neighbors to close borders and order strict quarantine. So what went wrong? From the start, the one-two punch of rapid contagion and the ensuing death toll caught local and national officials off guard. On Feb. 27, doctors in Guayaquil diagnosed the country\u2019s first Covid-19 patient, Bella Lamilla, a 71-year-old retired teacher, otherwise known as \u201cPatient Zero.\u201d Dr. Esteban Ortiz-Prado is a medical investigator helping to advise the government on the pandemic. It took 13 days to diagnose Lamilla with coronavirus. And in that time, she infected many other people, including much of her family, pictured here in 2019. In all, three family members died, including Bella herself. After she arrived in Ecuador, Lamilla stayed in the home of her niece, Cassandra, in the town of Babahoyo. Bella Lamilla was certainly not the only case. There were at least six other flights from Madrid to Guayaquil between the time she arrived and when she was diagnosed. Other travelers later tested positive for Covid-19. Those lost weeks led to an out-of-control epidemic. Two and a half weeks after Bella Lamilla\u2019s diagnosis, the country was on lockdown. Two weeks after that, Guayaquil was in the throes of the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. \u201cIt is true that at the very beginning, it was a disaster. We are learning by mistake, by errors that we made.\u201d This is Dr. Juan Carlos Zevallos. He was installed as Ecuador\u2019s health minister in late March, after the former minister resigned. He admits the government should have tested and tracked patients. But he also blames residents for not following stay-at-home orders after Bella\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cEcuador, as I said, was prepared. I mean, did all the measures in place and very early. Unfortunately, the people didn\u2019t hear us. And they did not obey those restrictions.\u201d Like a lot of cities in Latin America, a large segment of Guayaquil\u2019s population lives day to day, working informal jobs. So to stay home means not eating. It was a perfect storm of factors that left Guayaquil\u2019s hospitals and morgues overwhelmed. Now, the government of Ecuador has another dilemma: Just how to bury the thousands of bodies that have piled up in the weeks after Lamilla\u2019s death? Ecuador\u2019s official Covid death toll is several hundred. But forensic police have been working around the clock to collect and account for thousands more dead. And construction is now underway for various large burial sites around the city. Container trucks like this one transport corpses to one new site on the outskirts of Guayaquil, in the neighborhood of Pascuales. Local residents fearful of contamination are outraged. Officials in charge of handling the dead have promised that each body will have a separate resting place. We attempted to film drone footage of the new burial site. But Ecuadorean soldiers ordered our team to bring the drone down, and temporarily confiscated our footage. A human rights worker documented the incident. Since the first coronavirus diagnosis, distrust of the government\u2019s handling of this crisis appears to have spread as fast as the contagion itself."], "20200519": ["Episode transcription\n\nGo back to homepage\n\n[Theme In]\n\nSal Intro Quote: At the beginning of that week, things like, nationwide school closures seemed like an impossibility. And by the end of that week, it seemed like an inevitability. And so when we got closer to the end of that week, we realized it's one of those moments where you look left, look right. And you're like, I think this is us.\n\nAlicia Burke VO: It feels like everything has changed, yet here we are. This shared moment is causing us all to rethink our motivations, our missions. In this season of That Made All The Difference, we\u2019ll explore how this crisis is impacting achievers to help them respond and chart a course for the future.\n\nWe\u2019re kicking off this season by checking back in with Sal Khan, one of our guests from season 1. Khan Academy, the free, remote learning platform he\u2019s spent over a decade building, seems almost custom made for this moment. We\u2019ll find out how Sal and his family are doing, and how Khan Academy is adjusting to serving so many new students, teachers and parents. I caught up with Sal over video chat from my home outside Boston, to his in Palo Alto.\n\n[Theme out]\n\nAlicia Burke: Sal, thanks so much for joining\n\nSal Khan: Thanks for having me.\n\nAlicia Burke: I feel like I\u2019m talking with the Ellen of education. I've been watching your daily homeroom shows. So I feel like I see you every day now. How are you doing? and how is your family?\n\nSal Khan: Well, relatively speaking, I think I'm pretty lucky. Obviously, I'm dealing with the same things that everyone else is dealing with. But I'm fortunate, my wife is able to do some work remotely and then my mother in law lives with us. So we have a lot of adult support for our three children, their schools doing a great job keeping them learning. And, Khan Academy has a big role right now. And so I feel, in some ways fortunate to have something to do to help with the crisis.\n\nAlicia Burke: How is your family doing in New Orleans? Because I think you've got some family there too.\n\nSal Khan: That is a concern. My mother lives by herself, So you can imagine New Orleans has one of the highest per capita rates of COVID-19 my mom's in the high risk age group. And I also worry about just her you know, her mental health you know, I'm socially distanced in a house of six people. That's very different than being socially distanced all alone. You know, the silver lining is this has been a catalyst for me to be maybe a little bit better of a son. I think it's very easy for a lot of us to say, Oh, yeah, I'll call mom tomorrow or next week, But now I'm like, No, I gotta call her every day. And make sure she's all right. And it's been great. We've been having really good conversations.\n\nAlicia Burke: Oh, that's great. Yes, I do notice that I\u2019m more in touch with my mom, my mom is living alone. And I send her a picture of myself every day. She really, really enjoys that. And it's given us this new connection. She also tells me how good or bad looking I am every day, That's good, too. I'm getting feedback, even though you know, we're not together.\n\nSal Khan: Our mothers sound similar. Our mothers definitely sound similar.\n\nAlicia Burke: So, Sal, your three kids, how are they doing?\n\nSal Khan: I think they're doing pretty well considering the circumstances. They're eleven, eight and five. The 11 and eight year old, their school always had an emphasis on agency and students being able to do work independently. And so they've been able to transition to this pretty seamlessly. You can imagine the five year old\u2019s been a little bit difficult for everyone. And once again, we're lucky we have a backyard, we have some parks nearby, they're able to play with each other. So they're able to keep themselves pretty occupied.\n\nAlicia Burke: And are there any routines Sal, that you're doing that are keeping you sane in all of this?\n\nSal Khan: So I've always been a big fan of routine and I'm definitely doubling down on them, given the circumstance. First thing I do in the morning is I make the bed, it kind of gives me a quick win, then I meditate, and then you know some type of physical activity and, and then start my day and I think right now that type of thing is even more important. The other thing I'm doing, most of my meetings I'm doing walking. While I'm socially distanced and sitting in sometimes hours of meetings a day, I get a lot of exercise, a lot of fresh air and a lot of sun.\n\nAlicia Burke: That's a great idea. That's a great idea. I have noticed I have good days and bad days. The good days are when I stick to any kind of routine. My 13 year old daughter has given herself a challenge to run a mile every morning. And so I've jumped on her bandwagon, and I join her. It's almost as good as a cup of coffee. So my kids are teaching me as usual.\n\nSal Khan: Yeah, that pretty much describes a lot of my mornings I did I just do one lap around our local park and that's a little over a mile and if you really want to top it off as a coffee replacement, finish it off with a cold shower. That's another part of my ritual. I'm not kidding. I've been doing it for two years. You don't need caffeine, if you start your morning with a cold shower.\n\nAlicia Burke: Okay well, that'll be on the agenda tomorrow. And I'll save money too. So, Sal, you were ahead of your time. We know that. You started Khan Academy in 2005, I think. And since then you've built an incredible remote learning platform, you know, way before this crisis hit. And now millions of people and their families seemingly overnight are remote learning. I wondered, what have you learned as a leader of Khan Academy since this has begun?\n\nSal Khan: Yeah, and we're still learning. That week before school closures happened and it already feels like a lifetime ago. But people don't even realize that at the beginning of that week, things like, nationwide school closures seemed like an impossibility. And by the end of that week, it seemed like an inevitability. So when we got closer to the end of that week, we realized it's one of those moments where you look left look, right. And you're like, I think this is us. Because obviously, we've been building these resources, as you mentioned, for over a decade. We would have never foreseen this circumstance. The content that we've been creating over the last several years happens to be very well suited for the circumstance. But people were feeling overwhelmed. And so that weekend, we started scheduling teacher webinars, parent webinars to just help them think about how to \u201cvirtualize\u201d or whatever you want to call it. That Friday night, when it was clear that California for sure was going to close and likely many other states on Tuesday or Wednesday of the next week, myself and a couple of team members, we sat down and we said, okay, if we're a parent of a six year old, what could a schedule look like leveraging us and other resources if you're a parent of a 10 year old, if, if you are a 16 year old? How can you keep learning and those schedules that we put actually started off as just Google Docs, and we shared them, and then they went viral. That word has more meaning than it used to, they went viral overnight, and then we found ways for it for that to scale. But that was a very clear signal and a clear learning that people were feeling overwhelmed and they just needed supports. But we also started emphasizing, look, if you or your children are able to even do 30 minutes a day of math, 30 minutes a day of reading and 30 minutes a day of writing. And if you were to continue, not just to the end of the school year, but over the summer, you can rest assured that your child's skills won't atrophy. And we've gotten a lot of feedback from parents and teachers and students that that just lowered their stress level and that that allowed them to say, Okay, I can do this I can breathe. Let me put one foot in front of the other\n\nAlicia Burke: That's really interesting. It felt like the education wilderness. I know you've been working with superintendents across the country. It would be great to understand what you're hearing from them. What you're working on with them.\n\nSal Khan: Even before the crisis, a big part of our focus was working with schools and districts. And especially the large urban complex school districts that were serving a lot of underserved students. We were working very deeply with school districts like Clark County, which is the fifth largest in the country. That's essentially Las Vegas with 300,000 students where their assessments acted as diagnostics for practice on Khan Academy, and then the kids can learn at their own time and pace. And then we can see how that work on Khan Academy impacted their test scores and then COVID hits. And what we saw a couple of things, the districts that were already leveraging Khan Academy in significant ways, they were able to transition quite easily, especially in subjects like math where they were leaning quite heavily on us, but then we saw a whole other class of schools that, you know, literally in a matter of days had to come up with something. And it's hard if you know, when I talked to the superintendents, there's so many things that they have to think about, they have to think about free lunch programs, they have to think about kids with special needs, they have to think about device access. But at the same time, I think a lot of them rightfully said, perfect can't be the enemy of the good. In the name of equity, you could say let's not do anything because some kids don't have access. But then what will happen is if you do nothing, the middle income and upper middle income families will get something for their children. While the lower income families who do have a cell phone at home who could access some of this, they won't have anything.\n\nAlicia Burke: I noticed about my own kids who are 13 and 15, who have both used Khan Academy, pre COVID is that it's helped to make it easier for them to learn online like anything when you have more than one child, every child is so different. I think the recognition of the sort of individual-ness is paramount, but it's also really stressful for the teachers and the parents.\n\nSal Khan: Yeah, that might be one of the silver linings obviously, there's a lot of pain in the short run. People are going to lean more on the Khan Academy's of the world because of this crisis, it's accessible, it's accessible online and the content is there. But the byproduct is it will hopefully bring the whole system closer to this level of personalization. You know, it's hard to transition from a fixed pace to a personalized pace world. But this type of crisis, we're going to lean more on online, which can do the personalization, better. It's most ideal once in conjunction with amazing teachers. But I think this will get us thinking more and more in that way.\n\nAlicia Burke: One thing I've noticed is that my kids will much rather talk about how they're doing school-wise with my sister who's a guidance counselor than with me or my husband, they have an outlet to talk to someone who is understanding of them in a different way. So we've been trying to promote that more.\n\nSal Khan: I think you're absolutely right that kids connect more with these people, kind of maybe half a generation above, or sometimes it might be the same generation as the parents, but they just aren't their parents. Some of this is part of the founding story of Khan Academy. My cousin was having trouble with math, and my cousin would check out when her parents would talk to her about it. But when I asked her, hey, you want to work with me on it, there was this open mindedness to it. I've joked with Nadia and her brothers, I was like, now you got to pay it forward and do the same thing for my kids because my kids don't take me seriously either. I think there's something there.\n\nAlicia Burke: I saw you had Angela Duckworth as your guest the other day on your homeroom. And we wonder sometimes how much tough love we should be giving to our kids. You know, we were thinking, we were doing a really good job and then we get the email that our son missed his language class. During these times, how much do you say let it go? How much do you say, Listen, you need to keep your eye on the ball.\n\nSal Khan: I'm not an expert here. And actually, I'd argue almost no one is and, and, and you're further down the parenting journey than I am but my gut sense what I tried to tell myself is kids, like or don't mind, someone having accountability and expectations, as long as underlying that there's healthy perceptions. You know, I was very sensitive growing up that if my mom was holding me accountable because she was concerned what other people think, or because she thought it was reinforcing some stereotype that she already had of me, that's when I would react, that's when I would rebel. But if I felt that my mother fundamentally respected me, and that she wasn't being driven by you know, extrinsic motivators, what do other people think and that she was genuinely telling me something and I might disagree with her, but it was coming from an authentic, good centered place, then it would resonate and you know, frankly, that still happens with me you know, So I like what Angela Duckworth said is that, you know, as parents, we do need to hold our children accountable, we do need to have some expectations, but at the same time, they should always understand that they're loved unconditionally, and that we we see them as true people.\n\nAlicia Burke: I love that. And I love that you of all people are saying none of us are experts, because that's actually very consoling right now. You know, I wanted to ask you, Sal, I know you don't have a crystal ball, but you've already proven to be a visionary. So I need to ask you some visionary questions. What do you see? K through 12 education looking like over the next few years, you know, will it change forever?\n\nSal Khan: Well, a lot depends on what happens with the virus. But, you know, my sense of things is unless we get some type of miraculous vaccine in short order, it's likely that we're going to be in this strange Limbo state for 12 to 18 months at least. And as long as we're in that Limbo state, people are going to have to loosen their views of, when and where learning happens. So ideally, it is in a physical environment, but people will know that it might, you know, the schools when we go back to school, if COVID\u2019s still out there as it looks like it might be, you might have to be socially distanced, which means that there's not enough capacity so you might have to do shifts at the school, which means kids are still home some of the time or you might have to go back virtual with literally a week's notice. And so I think in a world like that everyone's going to think about the the work students do the credentials, the credit we've sometimes talked about it as going from a seat time model to a competency model. The competency model is you learn it, however you need to learn it. What matters is is that you eventually learn the material. And so I could imagine if you go to a competency based world, out of this crisis, people are going to find more standardized ways of saying, do you really know your algebra? At what level do you write?\n\nAlicia Burke: That's a really interesting way to think about it. What does that mean for Khan Academy as you look forward, again, no crystal ball, but what do you see yourselves continuing to focus on based on the future as you see it?\n\nSal Khan: Well, this crisis definitely changed our aperture of how much capacity we need just from a server point of view. Our traffic is 3X of what it was before the crisis, we've just crossed 100 million registered users, we were serving about 30 million learning minutes per day. Now that number is closer to 80, 90, some days 100 million learning minutes per day. So that's just one operational level. Like we have to figure out how do we have the resources to do that? Because that costs money and we give all this stuff away for free and we're funded through philanthropy. The other thing is we're just trying to accelerate a lot of things that were always part of the vision, but now need to exist, you know, essentially yesterday. Our offering Khan Academy kids, which starts with letters and numbers and colors, it's reading, writing, social emotional learning math, starting as early as ages two and it goes to the first grade standards. We're trying to build that out as quickly as possible. And actually, we just got some really great efficacy studies on a low income students who were able to work on that and essentially was able to close the gap in forty, 20 minutes sessions between some of these low income students and kids of families where the parents went to college or higher income. In any way we can, we're trying to advocate with government, Telecom carriers, corporate partners, philanthropists, ways for people to get access to the internet. I think it's very clear that this is now a human right. I have a couple of skunkworks projects. I'm working with teachers to facilitate essentially matchmaking service between students in a district who need help, and teachers in the district who might be able to provide the help. And what's interesting about that is you're still in your school district, but it's no longer one teacher and one student. It's now all the students and all of the teachers and it's been pretty exciting because now the teachers are co teaching, they're really enjoying it. And then the students are having access to a much broader group of teachers that they can connect with.\n\nAlicia Burke: Wow. So suffice it to say you have a lot on your plate. But to your point, it also requires a lot of resources.\n\nSal Khan: We were running a deficit even before this crisis. And you could imagine our costs have gone up since. And we've had, you know, many folks step out of the woodwork, both individual donors who are giving, you know, $3 a month, all the way to, you know, corporate partners, folks like Bank of America, Novartis, AT&T, Google.org, Fastly, But even with that, we're continuing to run a deficit. And you can only just dip into your reserves so long before you have to turn the lights out. And it would be a shame if this crisis were to cause us to run out of money. But I believe, I hope that if by us accelerating by pressing on the gas, we're going to be able to have even more impact, serve even more people. And then the world, you know, small donors, large donors, corporate partners, the government possibly will recognize that we're playing a very important role in the social return on investment of Khan Academy is, really off the charts.\n\nAlicia Burke: And by some of the examples that you shared, it's very clear that the world sees the value of what you're doing. As we are talking now, we're kind of on the cusp of summer, you've got these kids who are hoping for a little fun, and they're having some uncertainty for sure. Some people might say, Sal, should we just, you know, throw the laptops out the window for a few weeks and give it all a break? But I think I heard you before say, we need to keep something up along the way so that people are not falling behind.\n\nSal Khan: For any child, or any student, what I would recommend is, for sure, in math, keep up a habit of even 20, 30 minutes a day, that will keep that from atrophying. You might show up the next school year more prepared than you would have otherwise. And that might be a silver lining too that we can hopefully collect, we can build this habit as a society that summer is not a time to just completely check out, that it is a time to continue learning. And then you know, on the reading side, I mean, one, keep reading, you know, just try to read every day 20-30 minutes a day. If you're a parent of a younger student, have a conversation. You know, read an article in the newspaper or magazine with, with your children. Do some journaling. But I think if you're able to do light stuff like that through the summer, your children will be very prepared and frankly, do that all summers, gains always happen by forming a habit. It's not by you know, binge cramming or whatever you want to call it.\n\nAlicia Burke: I think what you're saying is, don't be afraid to go off the grid in terms of the formal schooling but stay engaged, whatever that looks like for you or your kids or your relatives.\n\nSal Khan: Yeah, I mean, you know, like my eight year old daughter, she's getting reasonably fluent in her multiplication tables. But every now and then I just say Diah six times seven. it's a fun little moment. But even that little thing, keeps that from atrophying.\n\nAlicia Burke: It's great. It's like a math push up in between other things.\n\nSal Khan: Exactly.\n\nAlicia Burke: Sal, I've been watching a lot of your daily homerooms, which I've really, really enjoyed. What I noticed about them is you're talking to all different kinds of people. You're covering all different kinds of topics and I'd love to hear what you've learned.\n\nSal Khan: Yeah, you know, this daily homeroom livestream we started is just a way to stay in touch to make people feel supported through the school closures, frankly, for even for our own sanity to feel connected to other people, you know, I'm operating out of the same walk in closet where Khan Academy all got started. Part of the joy I have of Khan Academy, it's been a vector for me to learn and teach many different things. I think especially now, in this crisis, there's big tectonic plates that are moving around, that are all related, you know, what's going to happen in education is related to what's going to happen with the virus, which is related to what's going to happen to the economy, and on and on and on and on. And so that's why we have guests, you know, we have folks like Angela Duckworth who can talk about grit and mindset. We had folks like Ray Dalio talk about the economy. We had Bill Gates on talking about the virus itself.\n\nAlicia Burke: I can tell you really enjoy them because you give off incredible energy during them. Sal, what would you say directly to students right now?\n\nSal Khan: This is a great time to reflect and build habits. You know, a lot of constraints have been lifted, And so use that time, use that time to build some of these habits we talked about once again, it doesn't have to be hours upon hours of studying, do 20 minutes a day of math, 20 minutes a day, make sure you keep reading, and this is a great opportunity to explore the world. Figure out your passions, you know, my 11 year old, he's starting his own YouTube channel, explaining you know chess. Great, like, that's awesome. Him and his friends over zoom, They're making movies where they're like sending each other parts of the videos and editing it together.\n\nWe've been getting a lot of emails and even on our live stream, we've been getting a lot of questions from older students, high school students, or college students or graduating college students. And you can imagine they're feeling a lot of anxiety but it's good to recognize that the greatest generations are the ones that come of age during times of adversity. I think that's going to make them more resilient, it's going to make them more reflective over what matters and what doesn't, and do some pretty, pretty powerful things. They're going to change the world.\n\nAlicia Burke: That is great. Sal, thanks to you and your team for making us smarter and making us more resilient. We can't wait to see what you do next.\n\nSal Khan: Thanks so much, Alicia. Thanks for having me.\n\n[Theme In]\n\nAlicia Burke VO: Sal will surely continue to innovate, no matter what he\u2019s faced with. Bank of America is proud to include Khan Academy as one of the recipients of the $100MM we\u2019ve granted to organizations working to make a positive impact during this crisis.\n\nJoin us next time on That Made All The Difference, when we\u2019ll talk with Dr. Wayne Frederick, President of Howard University, We\u2019ll speak with Dr. Frederick about the ways the institution and Howard University Hospital are helping their community in Washington D.C.\n\n[Theme Out]\n\nGo back to homepage", "Episode transcription\n\nGo back to homepage\n\nSal Intro Quote:\n\nAt the beginning of that week, things like, nationwide school closures seemed like an impossibility. And by the end of that week, it seemed like an inevitability. We realized it's one of those moments where you look left look, right. And you're like, I think this is us.\n\nAlicia Burke VO:\n\nSal Khan spent more than a decade building Khan Academy, the free remote learning platform. His company almost seems custom made for this moment. The tools they\u2019re providing to students, teachers and parents worldwide are fulfilling a pressing need. We\u2019ll find out how he and his family are doing, and how Khan Academy is adjusting to accommodate so many new users. I caught up with Sal over video chat from my home outside Boston, to his in the Bay Area.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nSal, thanks so much for joining.\n\nSal Khan\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nI feel like I\u2019m talking with the Ellen of education. I've been watching your daily homeroom shows. So I feel like I see you every day now. How are you doing? and how is your family?\n\nSal Khan\n\nWell, relatively speaking, I think I'm pretty lucky. Obviously, I'm dealing with the same things that everyone else is dealing with. But I'm fortunate, my wife is able to do some work remotely and then my mother-in-law lives with us. So we have a lot of adult support for our three children, their schools doing a great job keeping them learning. And, Khan Academy has a big role right now. And so I feel, in some ways fortunate to have something to do to help with the crisis.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nHow is your family doing in New Orleans? Because I think you've got some family there too.\n\nSal Khan\n\nThat is a concern. My mother lives by herself, So you can imagine New Orleans has one of the highest per capita rates of COVID-19, my mom's in the high risk age group. And I also worry about just her you know, her mental health you know, I'm socially distanced in a house of six people. That's very different than being socially distanced all alone. You know, the silver lining is this has been a catalyst for me to be maybe a little bit better of a son. I think it's very easy for a lot of us to say, Oh, yeah, I'll call mom tomorrow or next week, But now I'm like, No, I gotta call her every day. And make sure she's all right. And it's been great. We've been having really good conversations.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nYes, I do notice that I\u2019m more in touch with my mom, my mom is living alone. And I send her a picture of myself every day. She really, really enjoys that. And it's given us this new connection. She also tells me how good or bad looking I am every day, That's good, too. I'm getting feedback, even though you know, we're not together.\n\nSal Khan\n\nOur mothers sound similar. Our mothers definitely sound similar.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nSo, your three kids, how are they doing?\n\nSal Khan\n\nI think they're doing pretty well considering the circumstances. They're eleven, eight and five. The 11 and eight year old, their school always had an emphasis on agency and students being able to do work independently. And so they've been able to transition to this pretty seamlessly. You can imagine the five year old\u2019s been a little bit difficult for, for everyone. And once again, we're lucky we have a backyard, we have some parks nearby, they're able to play with each other. So they're able to keep themselves pretty occupied.\n\nAlicia Burke And are there any routines that you're doing that are keeping you sane in all of this?\n\nSal Khan So I've always been a big fan of routine and I'm definitely doubling down on them, given the circumstance. First thing I do in the morning is I make the bed, it kind of gives me a quick win, then I meditate, and then you know some type of physical activity and, and then start my day and I think right now that type of thing is even more important. The other thing I'm doing, most of my meetings I'm doing walking. While I'm socially distanced and sitting in sometimes hours of meetings a day, I get a lot of exercise, a lot of fresh air and a lot of sun.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nThat's a great idea. I have noticed I have good days and bad days. The good days are when I stick to any kind of routine. My 13-year-old daughter has given herself a challenge to run a mile every morning. And so I've jumped on her bandwagon, and I join her. It's almost as good as a cup of coffee. So my kids are teaching me as usual.\n\nSal Khan\n\nYeah, that pretty much describes a lot of my mornings I did I just do one lap around our local park and that's a little over a mile and if you really want to top it off as a coffee replacement, finish it off with a cold shower. That's another part of my ritual. I'm not kidding. I've been doing it for two years. You don't need caffeine, if you start your morning with a cold shower.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nOkay well, that'll be on the agenda tomorrow. And I'll save money too. So, you were ahead of your time. We know that. You started Khan Academy in 2005, I think. And since then you've built an incredible remote learning platform, you know, way before this crisis hit. And now millions of people and their families seemingly overnight are remote learning. I wondered, what have you learned as a leader of Khan Academy since this has begun?\n\nSal Khan\n\nYeah, and we're still learning. That week before school closures happened and it already feels like a lifetime ago. But people don't even realize that at the beginning of that week, things like, nationwide school closures seemed like an impossibility. And by the end of that week, it seemed like an inevitability. So when we got closer to the end of that week, we realized it's one of those moments where you look left, look right. And you're like, I think this is us. Because obviously, we've been building these resources, as you mentioned, for over a decade. We would have never foreseen this circumstance. The content that we've been creating over the last several years happens to be very well suited for the circumstance. But people were feeling overwhelmed. And so that weekend, we started scheduling teacher webinars, parent webinars to just help them think about how to \u201cvirtualize\u201d or whatever you want to call it. That Friday night, when it was clear that California for sure was going to close and likely many other states on Tuesday or Wednesday of the next week, myself and a couple of team members, we sat down and we said, okay, if we're a parent of a six year old, what could a schedule look like leveraging us and other resources if you're a parent of a 10 year old, if, if you are a 16 year old? How can you keep learning and those schedules that we put actually started off as just Google Docs, and we shared them, and then they went viral. That word has more meaning than it used to, they went viral overnight, and then we found ways for it for that to scale. But that was a very clear signal and a clear learning that people were feeling overwhelmed and they just needed supports. But we also started emphasizing, look, if you or your children are able to even do 30 minutes a day of math, 30 minutes a day of reading and 30 minutes a day of writing. And if you were to continue, not just to the end of the school year, but over the summer, you can rest assured that your child's skills won't atrophy. And we've gotten a lot of feedback from parents and teachers and students that that just lowered their stress level and that that allowed them to say, Okay, I can do this I can breathe. Let me put one foot in front of the other.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nThat's really interesting. It felt like the education wilderness. I know you've been working with superintendents across the country. It would be great to understand what you're hearing from them. What you're working on with them.\n\nSal Khan\n\nEven before the crisis, a big part of our focus was working with schools and districts. And especially the large urban complex school districts that were serving a lot of underserved students. We were working very deeply with school districts like Clark County, which is the fifth largest in the country. That's essentially Las Vegas with 300,000 students where their assessments acted as diagnostics for practice on Khan Academy, and then the kids can learn at their own time and pace. And then we can see how that work on Khan Academy impacted their test scores and then COVID hits. And what we saw a couple of things, the districts that were already leveraging Khan Academy in significant ways, they were able to transition quite easily, especially in subjects like math where they were leaning quite heavily on us, but then we saw a whole other class of schools that, you know, literally in a matter of days had to come up with something. And it's hard if you know, when I talked to the superintendents, there's so many things that they have to think about, they have to think about free lunch programs, they have to think about kids with special needs, they have to think about device access. But at the same time, I think a lot of them rightfully said, perfect can't be the enemy of the good. In the name of equity, you could say let's not do anything because some kids don't have access. But then what will happen is if you do nothing, the middle income and upper middle income families will get something for their children. While the lower income families who do have a cell phone at home who could access some of this, they won't have anything.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nI noticed about my own kids who are 13 and 15, who have both used Khan Academy, pre COVID is that it's helped to make it easier for them to learn online like anything when you have more than one child, every child is so different. I think the recognition of the sort of individual-ness is paramount, but it's also really stressful for the teachers and the parents.\n\nSal Khan\n\nYeah, that might be one of the silver linings obviously, there's a lot of pain in the short run. People are going to lean more on the Khan Academy's of the world because of this crisis, it's accessible, it's accessible online and the content is there. But the byproduct is it will hopefully bring the whole system closer to this level of personalization. You know, it's hard to transition from a fixed pace to a personalized pace world. But this type of crisis, we're going to lean more on online, which can do the personalization, better. It's most ideal once in conjunction with amazing teachers. But I think this will get us thinking more and more in that way.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that my kids will much rather talk about how they're doing school-wise with my sister who's a guidance counselor than with me or my husband, they have an outlet to talk to someone who is understanding of them in a different way. So we've been trying to promote that more.\n\nSal Khan\n\nI think you're absolutely right that kids connect more with these people, kind of maybe half a generation above, or sometimes it might be the same generation as the parents, but they just aren't their parents. Some of this is part of the founding story of Khan Academy. My cousin was having trouble with math, and my cousin would check out when her parents would talk to her about it. But when I asked her, hey, you want to work with me on it, there was this open mindedness to it. I've joked with Nadia and her brothers, I was like, now you got to pay it forward and do the same thing for my kids because my kids don't take me seriously either. I think there's something there.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nI saw you had Angela Duckworth as your guest the other day on your homeroom. And we wonder sometimes how much tough love we should be giving to our kids. You know, we were thinking, we were doing a really good job and then we get the email that our son missed his language class. During these times, how much do you say let it go? How much do you say, Listen, you need to keep your eye on the ball.\n\nSal Khan\n\nI'm not an expert here. And actually, I'd argue almost no one is and, and, and you're further down the parenting journey than I am but my gut sense what I tried to tell myself is kids, like or don't mind, someone having accountability and expectations, as long as underlying that there's healthy perceptions. You know, I was very sensitive growing up that if my mom was holding me accountable because she was concerned what other people think, or because she thought it was reinforcing some stereotype that she already had of me, that's when I would react, that's when I would rebel. But if I felt that my mother fundamentally respected me, and that she wasn't being driven by you know, extrinsic motivators, what do other people think and that she was genuinely telling me something and I might disagree with her, but it was coming from an authentic, good centered place, then it would resonate and you know, frankly, that still happens with me you know, So I like what Angela Duckworth said is that, you know, as parents, we do need to hold our children accountable, we do need to have some expectations, but at the same time, they should always understand that they're loved unconditionally, and that we, we see them as true people.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nI love that. And I love that you of all people are saying none of us are experts, because that's actually very consoling right now. You know I wanted to ask you, for Khan Academy, what do you see yourselves continuing to focus on based on the future as you see it?\n\nSal Khan\n\nWell, this crisis definitely changed our aperture of how much capacity we need just from a server point of view. Our traffic is 3X of what it was before the crisis, we've just crossed 100 million registered users, we were serving about 30 million learning minutes per day. Now that number is closer to 80, 90, some days 100 million learning minutes per day. So that's just one operational level. Like we have to figure out how do we have the resources to do that? Because that costs money and we give all this stuff away for free and we're funded through philanthropy. The other thing is we're just trying to accelerate a lot of things that were always part of the vision, but now need to exist, you know, essentially yesterday. Our offering Khan Academy kids, which starts with letters and numbers and colors, it's reading, writing, social emotional learning math, starting as early as ages two and it goes to the first grade standards. We're trying to build that out as quickly as possible. And actually, we just got some really great efficacy studies on a low income students who were able to work on that and essentially was able to close the gap in forty, 20 minutes sessions between some of these low income students and kids of families where the parents went to college or higher income. In any way we can, we're trying to advocate with government, Telecom carriers, corporate partners, philanthropists, ways for people to get access to the internet. I think it's very clear that this is now a human right. I have a couple of skunkworks projects. I'm working with teachers to facilitate essentially matchmaking service between students in a district who need help, and teachers in the district who might be able to provide the help. And what's interesting about that is you're still in your school district, but it's no longer one teacher and one student. It's now all the students and all of the teachers and it's been pretty exciting because now the teachers are co-teaching, they're really enjoying it. And then the students are having access to a much broader group of teachers that they can connect with.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nWow. So suffice it to say you have a lot on your plate. But to your point, it also requires a lot of resources.\n\nSal Khan\n\nWe were running a deficit even before this crisis. And you could imagine our costs have gone up since. And we've had, you know, many folks step out of the woodwork, both individual donors who are giving, you know, $3 a month, all the way to, you know, corporate partners, folks like Bank of America, Novartis, AT&T, Google.org, Fastly, But even with that, we're continuing to run a deficit. And you can only just dip into your reserves so long before you have to turn the lights out. And it would be a shame if this crisis were to cause us to run out of money. But I believe, I hope that if by us accelerating by pressing on the gas, we're going to be able to have even more impact, serve even more people. And then the world, small donors, large donors, corporate partners, the government possibly will recognize that we're playing a very important role in the social return on investment of Khan Academy is, really off the charts.\n\nAlicia Burke\n\nAnd by some of the examples that you shared, it's very clear that the world sees the value of what you're doing. As we are talking now, we're kind of on the cusp of summer, you've got these kids who are hoping for a little fun, and they're having some uncertainty for sure.

The tech columnist Kevin Roose explains how he convinced PewDiePie, one of the world\u2019s biggest and most polarizing YouTube influencers, to sit down with him for an interview:\n\nFor about two years, I had a recurring monthly reminder set up on my Google Calendar: \u201cAsk for PewDiePie interview.\u201d\n\nAs a student of internet culture and someone who spends way too much time on YouTube, I\u2019ve been intrigued for years by the Swedish YouTube comedian PewDiePie (real name: Felix Kjellberg). Kjellberg is YouTube\u2019s biggest celebrity \u2014 and one of the most famous people in the world. He has more than 100 million subscribers and an intense fandom, known as the \u201cBro Army,\u201d that hangs on his every word. (If you\u2019ve never heard of PewDiePie, you\u2019re not alone, but you\u2019re also probably not under 25.) He\u2019s also one of YouTube\u2019s most controversial creators, because of his history of edgy, crude humor. Anti-Semitic jokes he told on his channel once got him labeled by critics as an alt-right sympathizer and nearly blew up his career.\n\nI wanted to profile him, badly, but there was a problem: He was aggressively hostile toward the mainstream media, which he said took him out of context and sensationalized its coverage of his channel. Over and over again, I emailed his publicist asking for an interview, and the answer always came back: No thanks.\n\nStill, I kept asking. And finally, last year, I got a surprising call. Kjellberg wanted to talk. Just weeks earlier, the terrorist responsible for the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, had said PewDiePie\u2019s name before entering a mosque and killing dozens of Muslims. Kjellberg was upset about being linked to such a horrible tragedy, so he invited me to his hometown \u2014 Brighton, a charming seaside city in Britain \u2014 to hear him out. It would be his first mainstream media interview in years and a rare chance to see him out of character.\n\nA few days later \u2014 after convincing a few editors that landing an interview with PewDiePie, on my beat, was like getting an Oval Office sitdown with the president \u2014 I packed my bags and flew to London. I met Kjellberg at an Airbnb near his house, and we talked for hours about his controversies, his political beliefs and his war with the media.\n\nIt was a fascinating day, one that revealed to me how Kjellberg feels caught in a tug-of-war between his fans, who want him to push the limits, and the world outside YouTube, where he risks getting in trouble for crossing the line.", "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On his walking tours of the Tenderloin, a historically seamy neighborhood named for a cut of beef, Del Seymour passes Boeddeker Park, now a verdant jewel of urbanity.
