Democrats and voting rights groups have charged that the cuts are part of a deliberate effort by President Trump to undermine the service in order to interfere with mail-in voting that will be critical to a safe election in November. Democrats have called for $3.6 billion in the aid package to ensure a secure election, including broader mail balloting, but Republicans are opposing the funds.\n\nOther outstanding disputes include whether to appropriate hundreds of billions of dollars to help states and local governments avoid laying off public workers as tax revenues fall, and whether to reinstate a $600 per week unemployment supplement from the federal government to laid-off workers.\n\nDemocrats are pressing to extend the payments, which lapsed last week, through January. Republicans on Tuesday countered with a plan to resume them at $400 per week through Dec. 15, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions who insisted on anonymity to describe them. Democrats declined the offer, they said.\n\n\u201cThere are no top-line numbers that have been agreed to,\u201d Mr. Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said after the Capitol Hill meeting, charging that Democrats were unwilling to make significant concessions. \u201cWe continue to be trillions of dollars apart in terms of what Democrats and Republicans hopefully will ultimately compromise on.\u201d", "\u201cThe Bidens are looking for somebody as loyal to them as they were to Barack and Michelle Obama,\u201d Christine Pelosi, the daughter of the speaker, told my colleagues recently.\n\nAlthough, as my colleague Lisa Lerer wrote, it\u2019s best not to get too caught up in the chatter.\n\nSo, how does this all affect California?\n\nMs. Bass and Ms. Harris are not the only competitors, of course; the Biden campaign is orchestrating an unusually public \u201cveepstakes,\u201d in which all the contenders are established public servants who would represent subtly different visions of the Democratic Party, said Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden\u2019s announcement during the primaries that he\u2019d choose a woman for the job has helped head off less substantive discussion about a woman\u2019s electability and instead focused it on which woman would be most likely to help Mr. Biden beat the president.

The explosiveness of its parting lyrics, its references to drugs and vigilantism caught the public\u2019s attention and broke boundaries: Something taboo was being uttered on a record for the first time in a popular song by a Black woman entertainer. Bradford\u2019s gamble on \u201ca Black woman nobody\u2019s ever heard of,\u201d as the popular music historian Elijah Wald put it in a phone interview, was \u201ca huge conceptual leap.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Black listeners were dazzled by a phenomenally well-executed record that captured an even bigger, existential ache than its lyrics describe. It was an expression of the grandeur and complexity of Black life, finally available for their phonograph. Sales figures for \u201cCrazy Blues\u201d show an estimated 75,000 copies purchased upon its release, and in 1921 Billboard credited the song as pulling in \u201ca million dollars\u2019 worth,\u201d a giant sum at the time that stood for \u201clots and lots\u201d in this era, Wald said.\n\nBlack recording artists subsequently made significant inroads riding the coattails of Smith\u2019s success. Blues women dominated the first half of the decade, with Waters, Rainey and Bessie Smith at the forefront of the craze. Waters\u2019s popularity would almost single-handedly keep the African-American-owned Black Swan Records afloat in the early 1920s. Rainey, called \u201cthe Mother of the Blues,\u201d signed with Paramount Records in 1923 and would go on to crank out more than 100 songs covering topics like lesbian pride and the perils of patriarchy. And that other Smith, the \u201cEmpress\u201d Bessie, would hold court at Columbia Records as the most formidable and original voice of the blues.\n\nThese were the pioneers who upended the soundtrack of American life. Record labels now believed in the (monetary) value of Black mass cultural art, and they provided Black artists with access \u2014 though still heavily mediated by white executives \u2014 to recording their own music.

I stand here tonight not only as governor of Florida, but as a husband, a father, a son and a friend to have a conversation about how we as Floridians approach these challenging times. As a parent of three, I know that my fellow parents here in Florida want nothing more than to provide a bright future for their children. And here\u2019s the hard truth. While the risks to students from in-person learning are low, the cost of keeping schools closed are enormous.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDana, tell me about this situation with schools in Florida.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIn early July, just as the Trump administration from Washington was pushing schools to reopen their physical campuses across the country, Florida was the state that really leaned heavily in that same direction under their Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\narchived recording (ron desantis) The important thing is that our parents have a meaningful choice when it comes to in-person education. Let\u2019s not let fear get the best of us and harm our children in the process.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThe state issued this executive order.\n\narchived recording The state is announcing it\u2019s requiring all schools to reopen for in-person classes next month, August.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nTelling schools that they had to reopen five days a week.\n\narchived recording 1 So that announcement coming today, given where Florida is. Your analysis. archived recording 2 I mean my analysis is that that is insane\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnd this was shocking to superintendents and school boards. You know, they had spent the months of May, June, into July mostly planning for a hybrid model of education. Kids would go to school two or three, or maybe even just one day a week in person, and be home learning online the rest of the time. School districts all of a sudden were being told you have to offer parents and families the option of five days a week in the building.\n\narchived recording So we are not ready to open schools in four weeks. We need to slow down and take a pause and get this right around the state first.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what would happen if schools didn\u2019t physically reopen five days a week?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYou know, I think the kind of underlying threat was that you would lose state dollars if you don\u2019t provide families with this option for in-person learning. And this threat to them was quite scary. Because state funding for education is the main funding that funds our school system in the United States.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was the state of the pandemic when the state of Florida makes this demand?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo these numbers were so shocking to us when we did reporting on this that we actually fact checked them many, many times to make sure they were correct.\n\narchived recording Florida shattering its daily record, recording more than 15,000 cases, accounting for a quarter of the total new daily cases in the United States.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIn some south Florida counties in the month of July \u2014\n\narchived recording South Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade has seen a staggering daily positivity rate of 33 percent.\n\ndana goldstein\n\n\u2014 between 20 and 30 percent of coronavirus tests were coming back positive. And the World Health Organization, the state of California, the state of New York have tended to use a range of about 5 percent to 10 percent test positivity rates as something to look at when deciding whether or not to open schools. So here you might see, you know, four times that number in a city like Miami.\n\narchived recording Here in Miami-Dade, according to county data released yesterday, the goal for the county is not to exceed 10 percent. They have exceeded that for the past 14 days.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nA strong indication that the virus is completely unchecked in that region. In fact, it was one of the most dangerous cities for the virus in the United States.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So what was the reaction across Florida to this executive order?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnger.\n\narchived recording If the governor wants to open schools publicly, how about we invite him to come and teach in the classroom? [CHEERING]\n\ndana goldstein\n\nA lot of teachers and educators were angry.\n\narchived recording If he wants to open schools, how about he provide teachers with hazard pay? Because that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re on the frontlines of a pandemic that you didn\u2019t start, you didn\u2019t call for and we don\u2019t have control for.

This is a democracy. Our voices need to be heard.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnd my inbox and social media were filled with messages from teachers.\n\narchived recording So I want everyone to hear my voice that if I die from catching Covid-19 from being forced back into Pinellas County Schools, you can drop my dead body right here! Leave my body right here! [CHEERING]\n\n[music]\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnd it was just this sense that the question of whether we should go back did not pay enough attention to teachers\u2019 health risks.\n\narchived recording 1 Do you feel ready to return to your classroom? archived recording 2 I do not. I personally have lost sleep over it. I\u2019ve cried over it. I cry over it a lot. It\u2019s very, very scary. And the one thing I\u2019m going to say, I will say online learning is not ideal. But it will keep our children safe. archived recording I\u2019m a teacher. I\u2019ve been with Duval County for 23 years. I have a mother at home that is sick. And if I am to get the coronavirus, I don\u2019t want to bring it back to her.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYes, it\u2019s really important that kids get educated. It\u2019s really important that parents be able to work during the day and children have the basic childcare that schools provide. However \u2014\n\narchived recording 1 We teachers love our students. And we agree that the best place for students is in school. But that\u2019s only if they\u2019re safe. If going to school is more dangerous for students or for their families, then we should hold off and do some sort of distance learning or a hybrid model until it\u2019s safe for them. archived recording 2 I think there\u2019s no way to social distance in our already crowded classrooms. There is not enough money to provide for the extra staff that we would need and the extra P.P.E. that we would need. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s worth the risk.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWe are used to going into schools that sometimes don\u2019t have soap in the bathrooms, that sometimes have broken windows that prevent us from circulating fresh air, that have dated heating and ventilation systems. And where is our health in this equation?\n\narchived recording This is not how I want to go back. And I want to go back so bad. Because I love teaching. I miss my classroom. I miss my kids.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what did teachers in Florida do?\n\narchived recording The largest teachers union in Florida is suing the state over its executive order mandating that schools reopen next month with in-person instruction.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo a bunch of the local and national union groups that represent teachers came together and they sued the state of Florida.\n\narchived recording In the lawsuit, the union says the state is unconstitutionally forcing millions of students and teachers into unsafe schools.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSaying that this executive order requiring schools to reopen five days a week in person actually violated Florida\u2019s own state law that also calls for schools to be safe.\n\narchived recording The suit says children are at risk of contracting and spreading the virus and of developing severe illness, resulting in death. And the state mandate to open schools is impossible to comply with C.D.C. guidelines on physical distancing, hygiene and sanitation if schools are operating at full capacity.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIt\u2019s really very simple what they were arguing, that going back five days a week is not safe and therefore, cannot be legal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. I have to think that it\u2019s a pretty unusual act, you know, teachers suing to stop their own schools from reopening.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYes. It\u2019s definitely unusual and notable. And interestingly, it paved the way for similar threats to sue across the country, including in northern cities like Chicago and New York. And shortly after this Florida suit came down \u2014\n\narchived recording The American Federation of Teachers has told its 1.7 million members that if they choose to strike, the union will have their back.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers, which is one of the two national unions, authorized any of their locals across the country to plan a strike in the event that safety precautions are not being met to reopen schools.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So a national teachers union is saying, a grounds for striking \u2014 which traditionally we\u2019ve always thought of as wages, health care, those kinds of issues \u2014 they\u2019re now saying you may decide to strike over unsafe school conditions in the middle of this pandemic?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nExactly. The threat to strike is very powerful and pragmatic. Because once teachers threaten to strike over the safety measures and questions of funding, it really puts pressure on the local school districts to give them a big seat at the table. And just the core decision, which is, are we even going to try to have in-person school this fall?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Dana, as teachers are seeking a place at the table and threatening to strike if they don\u2019t feel like schools are safe, what exactly are they asking for in order to feel ready to return to the classroom?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWe\u2019re seeing a very broad range of demands from teachers. And it runs the spectrum from very specific and achievable requests, to ones that are hugely ambitious, time consuming, expensive, or maybe even impossible to achieve while we\u2019re still experiencing any transmission of Covid-19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo for example in Orlando, when I spoke to teachers there in July, the requests were really quite reasonable. They wanted face masks to be required. They wanted temperature checks in all school district buildings. And then, the American Federation of Teachers, the national union that authorized strikes, had a very specific set of demands that they were looking for nationally. They wanted to see test positivity rates for the virus below 5 percent, transmission rates below 1 percent, effective contact tracing for the entire region, the school to require masks, update ventilation systems, and put in place procedures to maintain six feet of distance.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo very much sort of in line with C.D.C. guidelines for being as safe as possible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the union is making demands of an entire community, and level of infection and transmission and contact tracing beyond the school?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nExactly. They\u2019re expecting those things to work in the whole region before you sort of even get to the question of what sort of P.P.E. is available to teachers or something like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat about less practical requests from teachers?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo there you see this big movement bubbling up on social media under the hashtag #14daysnonewcases. And this is really quite a radical demand for schools not to reopen physically until there are no new cases in a region for 14 days. Now many nations have been able to reopen their schools safely without achieving that standard. And when I\u2019ve spoken to public health experts about this, what they say is, you know, \u201c14 days no new cases\u201d is not just a controlled pandemic, it\u2019s essentially the end of the pandemic in that region. And it might require a vaccine to get to that standard. Not just a vaccine that exists and works, but that has actually been deployed widely. When will that occur? Will that occur six months from now, 12 months from now, two years from now? We just don\u2019t know the answer to that. And those start to be very big numbers when you\u2019re thinking about children being out of school.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder what these demands from teachers look like to parents in this moment. I mean, I\u2019m mindful that many parents want their kids to return to school for a variety of very understandable reasons.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThat\u2019s right. I mean, I think the really hard thing is that there is no consensus or even strong majority opinion among parents. One recent national poll found about 60 percent of parents at this moment believe it\u2019s smarter to delay reopening physical schools until the virus subsides somewhat and there are more safety measures in place. But in some big cities, where the virus has been relatively well-controlled, like New York and Chicago, polls have found that a majority of families do have some willingness to send their kids back to school. And to add another layer of complication, it tends to be parents of color and low income parents that are the most scared of the health threats to their children of congregating in school buildings. But those families are also the most concerned about their kids falling back socially and academically because schools are closed. So there is just no consensus among parents as to what they feel is safe. It would in some ways be easier if American parents all agreed with each other about what was right here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMhm. And of course in the absence of physically returning to schools, we\u2019re left with online learning. And we have covered on the show the problems with how teachers and school districts are approaching that.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYeah. So in the spring, only a small segment of American school districts actually required teachers to teach live lessons over something like Zoom video. And here I think there is actually more risk of tension between parents and teachers. Because we\u2019re starting to see from polls what parents are asking for in a situation of continued remote learning. They were not happy that in the spring, many of their kids did not see teachers live over video. Many teachers were interacting with their students primarily over email at sort of random times per day. And that\u2019s not what parents want. They want their students to log on at very specific times and be in something like an online class, where they would have small group breakout sessions and discussions and have the opportunity to ask the teacher questions and get individualized feedback. And teachers unions are still, in some cases, resisting some of these practices, including even showing their faces on live video.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Dana, why would that be? I guess I\u2019m confused. If teachers are deeply reluctant to return to schools for very understandable reasons that you just outlined, and they don\u2019t feel school districts are meeting them halfway, why would they simultaneously be resisting a more enriched online remote teaching experience?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWell, some of them make the argument that it\u2019s not fair to provide too much live instruction, because students who don\u2019t have an adult to supervise their online learning at home, say, at exactly 10:00 a.m., might just miss out on the live lesson. So they think that that mode of education is not effective. But I\u2019ve also heard some arguments much simpler than that, that they don\u2019t want their homes to be shown. They\u2019re not comfortable in that medium. And they believe it\u2019s a violation of their own privacy to be shown from home in that way. So it\u2019s a range of different arguments there.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat would seem to raise a real crisis. I mean, teachers both not wanting to be in classrooms, but also not wanting to teach online the way parents want them to.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWell, this has been the sort of crux of these very tense latest negotiations across the country between teachers and school district leaders.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDana, I know a bunch of school districts around the country have actually started classes in schools. And I wonder how that has played out.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWell, there have been some horror stories, unfortunately.\n\narchived recording In Georgia, this photo of a crowded hallway, no mask in sight, from North Paulding High School went viral after the school opened for in-person learning on August 3.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYou know, for one of the first school districts to reopen, which was in Georgia, hundreds of staff were told to stay home because of potential exposure to the virus.\n\narchived recording Today the school remain closed, a week after that reopening.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIn Indiana \u2014\n\narchived recording One student at Greenfield Central Junior High tested positive on the very first day of school.\n\ndana goldstein\n\n\u2014 right away this junior high school was having to call teachers and call students\u2019 families and ask them to stay home for two weeks.\n\narchived recording Students at Elwood Junior Senior High now have to go remote after staff members there tested positive for Covid-19.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nNow that\u2019s extremely alarming. But I want to say that nobody who\u2019s a public health or education expert believes that we\u2019re going to reopen schools without students and teachers showing up from time to time positive for Covid-19. That\u2019s not a realistic expectation. But what we do need is procedures in place to deal with that when it happens. I mean, it needs to be clear who is getting told to stay home for two weeks. And, is their access to testing for anyone who came in contact with that positive individual? So in many ways, I think these anecdotes that we\u2019re hearing of kind of first-day-back crises in towns and cities that are trying to reopen physically do show that many of the concerns that teachers have brought to the table here are quite legitimate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo those are a small number of districts that have already reopened. But of course, many of the nation\u2019s largest school districts \u2014 Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., among others, are now firmly saying that they will not physically reopen schools at least initially. And that represents millions of students. So do teachers unions and teachers see that as a kind of victory?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThey do see it as a victory, absolutely. They believe that it\u2019s not only what\u2019s necessary to protect their health but to prevent schools emerging as potential hot spots for spreading Covid-19. But I think within that victory, there is also a real tragedy for American children and actually for our country. Because to be in a place where the needs of public health and safety are really juxtaposed against our ability to fully educate our kids, is to be in a place that very few other developed nations are in right now. And it is because of our failure to control the pandemic itself. We are looking at the real likelihood that millions or tens of millions of children do not attend school for an entire year. A full year of no school. And we just know that it\u2019s going to lead to big problems. It\u2019s going to make kids less likely to learn to read. It\u2019s going to probably lead to higher high school dropout rates. It\u2019s going to lead to students who don\u2019t have enough to eat, because school is where they are fed. And to students that don\u2019t have access to the mental health counseling and the special education services that they get at schools. So the fact that we\u2019re having to choose between everything crucial that the physical school provides and public health, it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s stunning to me as a 15-year veteran on the education beat and just also as a parent. You know, my daughter is going to come through this pandemic just fine. She has access to a great childcare and we have a lot of resources in our home and family to bring her through this. But still, it\u2019s really sad for our family that she\u2019s missing the preschool experience that we really wanted her to have. It\u2019s been months since she was with teachers and socializing with a group of students. And she\u2019s started even to become more timid around other kids, we\u2019ve noticed when we do take those walks out to the playground. And you know, it\u2019s sad for our family. And it\u2019s just a tiny microcosm of how sad it is for our country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDana, thank you very much.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThank you so much, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nStarting this week, several Florida school districts began holding in-person classes, even as the lawsuit filed by the state\u2019s teachers union moves ahead.

When productions are honed in front of homogeneous, majority-white audiences, it rewards their point of view, he said. Now, the theater needs to take stock as an artistic entity: \u201cThat\u2019s what those folks find funny. Is that what we want our shows to be? Is that standard a high enough bar for what we need to do?\u201d\n\nThe revamp is tangible, starting with the photos of alumni adorning the theater\u2019s lobby \u2014 a sea of white faces, to be replaced with a newer, and more diverse, roster of performers.\n\nThen there is the material itself: the company leans heavily on its archives, asking students and touring artists to delve into a catalog of thousands of sketches from its 60-year history. Characters of color are largely absent or rife with stereotypes. \u201cI had nothing,\u201d Peter Kim, the first openly gay Asian man hired for the mainstage, said of his experience as a touring performer in 2014. Now a committee will cull through the archives and reject sketches and scenarios that might be offensive (like those that led white directors to use the N-word, which Perkins experienced).\n\nThis is the easy stuff.

What\u2019s new is that the usual solutions parents patch together \u2014 schools, child care programs, babysitters, relatives and neighbors \u2014 are less likely to be available now because of the need for social distancing.\n\nThere was a period in the 1970s and early 1980s, after women had begun entering the work force in large numbers, when the country considered the idea that government and employer policies could help both men and women work and care for their families, through flexible hours, subsidized child care and paid leave. But the country landed on the opposite approach.\n\nThe United States stands out among rich countries in its lack of family-friendly policies. Swedish parents, for example, get 16 months of paid leave that can be used until their children are 8, and subsidized preschool. Canadian parents are eligible for up to 18 months of paid leave.\n\nIndividualizing decisions like these appeals to American ideals of independence and freedom. It also works to ensure that they remain individual decisions because, research shows, it ends up reducing support for public policies in support of the greater good and decreasing empathy for people with fewer advantages.\n\nFeeling guilty about parenting decisions in this context is distinctly American among advanced nations, according to social scientists. Unlike mothers in European countries, American mothers tend to blame themselves when decisions don\u2019t turn out well rather than other forces, according to research by Caitlyn Collins, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\u201cMoms are feeling acute and crushing guilt,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think of families as a private and personal responsibility, and in the face of a global pandemic, it means this work falls on women\u2019s shoulders.

If you worry that your teen might be experiencing depression or suicidal thoughts, there are a few things you can do to help. Dr. Christine Moutier, the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suggests these steps: Look for changes. Notice shifts in sleeping and eating habits in your teen, as well as any issues he or she might be having at school, such as slipping grades. Watch for angry outbursts, mood swings and a loss of interest in activities they used to love. Stay attuned to their social media posts as well. Keep the lines of communication open. If you notice something unusual, start a conversation. But your child might not want to talk. In that case, offer him or her help in finding a trusted person to share their struggles with instead. Seek out professional support. A child who expresses suicidal thoughts may benefit from a mental health evaluation and treatment. You can start by speaking with your child\u2019s pediatrician or a mental health professional. In an emergency: If you have immediate concern for your child\u2019s safety, do not leave him or her alone. Call a suicide prevention lifeline. Lock up any potentially lethal objects. Children who are actively trying to harm themselves should be taken to the closest emergency room. Resources If you\u2019re worried about someone in your life and don\u2019t know how to help, these resources can offer guidance:1. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) 2.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nSo far, the debate over school reopenings has been dominated by a president who is determined to send students back into classrooms \u2014\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We want to reopen the schools. Everybody wants it. The moms want it. The dads want it. The kids want it. It\u2019s time to do it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 and by local school officials, who are answering that call.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) So we\u2019re very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday: My colleague Dana Goldstein on why teachers and their unions are defying those plans. It\u2019s Thursday, August 13.\n\narchived recording (ron desantis) Good evening. I stand here tonight not only as governor of Florida, but as a husband, a father, a son and a friend to have a conversation about how we as Floridians approach these challenging times. As a parent of three, I know that my fellow parents here in Florida want nothing more than to provide a bright future for their children. And here\u2019s the hard truth. While the risks to students from in-person learning are low, the cost of keeping schools closed are enormous.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDana, tell me about this situation with schools in Florida.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIn early July, just as the Trump administration from Washington was pushing schools to reopen their physical campuses across the country, Florida was the state that really leaned heavily in that same direction under their Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\narchived recording (ron desantis) The important thing is that our parents have a meaningful choice when it comes to in-person education. Let\u2019s not let fear get the best of us and harm our children in the process.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThe state issued this executive order.\n\narchived recording The state is announcing it\u2019s requiring all schools to reopen for in-person classes next month, August.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nTelling schools that they had to reopen five days a week.\n\narchived recording 1 So that announcement coming today, given where Florida is. Your analysis. archived recording 2 I mean my analysis is that that is insane\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnd this was shocking to superintendents and school boards. You know, they had spent the months of May, June, into July mostly planning for a hybrid model of education. Kids would go to school two or three, or maybe even just one day a week in person, and be home learning online the rest of the time. School districts all of a sudden were being told you have to offer parents and families the option of five days a week in the building.\n\narchived recording So we are not ready to open schools in four weeks. We need to slow down and take a pause and get this right around the state first.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what would happen if schools didn\u2019t physically reopen five days a week?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYou know, I think the kind of underlying threat was that you would lose state dollars if you don\u2019t provide families with this option for in-person learning. And this threat to them was quite scary. Because state funding for education is the main funding that funds our school system in the United States.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was the state of the pandemic when the state of Florida makes this demand?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo these numbers were so shocking to us when we did reporting on this that we actually fact checked them many, many times to make sure they were correct.\n\narchived recording Florida shattering its daily record, recording more than 15,000 cases, accounting for a quarter of the total new daily cases in the United States.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIn some south Florida counties in the month of July \u2014\n\narchived recording South Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade has seen a staggering daily positivity rate of 33 percent.\n\ndana goldstein\n\n\u2014 between 20 and 30 percent of coronavirus tests were coming back positive. And the World Health Organization, the state of California, the state of New York have tended to use a range of about 5 percent to 10 percent test positivity rates as something to look at when deciding whether or not to open schools. So here you might see, you know, four times that number in a city like Miami.\n\narchived recording Here in Miami-Dade, according to county data released yesterday, the goal for the county is not to exceed 10 percent. They have exceeded that for the past 14 days.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nA strong indication that the virus is completely unchecked in that region. In fact, it was one of the most dangerous cities for the virus in the United States.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So what was the reaction across Florida to this executive order?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnger.\n\narchived recording If the governor wants to open schools publicly, how about we invite him to come and teach in the classroom? [CHEERING]\n\ndana goldstein\n\nA lot of teachers and educators were angry.\n\narchived recording If he wants to open schools, how about he provide teachers with hazard pay? Because that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re on the frontlines of a pandemic that you didn\u2019t start, you didn\u2019t call for and we don\u2019t have control for. [CHEERING]\n\ndana goldstein\n\nBecause they felt that their safety and, in some respects, safety of the entire community from a public health perspective was nowhere in this conversation.\n\narchived recording I teach my students the history of America, how this government has run, how it works. This is a democracy. Our voices need to be heard.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnd my inbox and social media were filled with messages from teachers.\n\narchived recording So I want everyone to hear my voice that if I die from catching Covid-19 from being forced back into Pinellas County Schools, you can drop my dead body right here! Leave my body right here! [CHEERING]\n\n[music]\n\ndana goldstein\n\nAnd it was just this sense that the question of whether we should go back did not pay enough attention to teachers\u2019 health risks.\n\narchived recording 1 Do you feel ready to return to your classroom? archived recording 2 I do not. I personally have lost sleep over it. I\u2019ve cried over it. I cry over it a lot. It\u2019s very, very scary. And the one thing I\u2019m going to say, I will say online learning is not ideal. But it will keep our children safe. archived recording I\u2019m a teacher. I\u2019ve been with Duval County for 23 years. I have a mother at home that is sick. And if I am to get the coronavirus, I don\u2019t want to bring it back to her.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYes, it\u2019s really important that kids get educated. It\u2019s really important that parents be able to work during the day and children have the basic childcare that schools provide. However \u2014\n\narchived recording 1 We teachers love our students. And we agree that the best place for students is in school. But that\u2019s only if they\u2019re safe. If going to school is more dangerous for students or for their families, then we should hold off and do some sort of distance learning or a hybrid model until it\u2019s safe for them. archived recording 2 I think there\u2019s no way to social distance in our already crowded classrooms. There is not enough money to provide for the extra staff that we would need and the extra P.P.E. that we would need. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s worth the risk.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWe are used to going into schools that sometimes don\u2019t have soap in the bathrooms, that sometimes have broken windows that prevent us from circulating fresh air, that have dated heating and ventilation systems. And where is our health in this equation?\n\narchived recording This is not how I want to go back. And I want to go back so bad. Because I love teaching. I miss my classroom. I miss my kids.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what did teachers in Florida do?\n\narchived recording The largest teachers union in Florida is suing the state over its executive order mandating that schools reopen next month with in-person instruction.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo a bunch of the local and national union groups that represent teachers came together and they sued the state of Florida.\n\narchived recording In the lawsuit, the union says the state is unconstitutionally forcing millions of students and teachers into unsafe schools.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSaying that this executive order requiring schools to reopen five days a week in person actually violated Florida\u2019s own state law that also calls for schools to be safe.\n\narchived recording The suit says children are at risk of contracting and spreading the virus and of developing severe illness, resulting in death. And the state mandate to open schools is impossible to comply with C.D.C. guidelines on physical distancing, hygiene and sanitation if schools are operating at full capacity.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIt\u2019s really very simple what they were arguing, that going back five days a week is not safe and therefore, cannot be legal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. I have to think that it\u2019s a pretty unusual act, you know, teachers suing to stop their own schools from reopening.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYes. It\u2019s definitely unusual and notable. And interestingly, it paved the way for similar threats to sue across the country, including in northern cities like Chicago and New York. And shortly after this Florida suit came down \u2014\n\narchived recording The American Federation of Teachers has told its 1.7 million members that if they choose to strike, the union will have their back.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers, which is one of the two national unions, authorized any of their locals across the country to plan a strike in the event that safety precautions are not being met to reopen schools.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So a national teachers union is saying, a grounds for striking \u2014 which traditionally we\u2019ve always thought of as wages, health care, those kinds of issues \u2014 they\u2019re now saying you may decide to strike over unsafe school conditions in the middle of this pandemic?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nExactly. The threat to strike is very powerful and pragmatic. Because once teachers threaten to strike over the safety measures and questions of funding, it really puts pressure on the local school districts to give them a big seat at the table. And just the core decision, which is, are we even going to try to have in-person school this fall?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Dana, as teachers are seeking a place at the table and threatening to strike if they don\u2019t feel like schools are safe, what exactly are they asking for in order to feel ready to return to the classroom?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWe\u2019re seeing a very broad range of demands from teachers. And it runs the spectrum from very specific and achievable requests, to ones that are hugely ambitious, time consuming, expensive, or maybe even impossible to achieve while we\u2019re still experiencing any transmission of Covid-19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo for example in Orlando, when I spoke to teachers there in July, the requests were really quite reasonable. They wanted face masks to be required. They wanted temperature checks in all school district buildings. And then, the American Federation of Teachers, the national union that authorized strikes, had a very specific set of demands that they were looking for nationally. They wanted to see test positivity rates for the virus below 5 percent, transmission rates below 1 percent, effective contact tracing for the entire region, the school to require masks, update ventilation systems, and put in place procedures to maintain six feet of distance.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo very much sort of in line with C.D.C. guidelines for being as safe as possible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the union is making demands of an entire community, and level of infection and transmission and contact tracing beyond the school?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nExactly. They\u2019re expecting those things to work in the whole region before you sort of even get to the question of what sort of P.P.E. is available to teachers or something like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat about less practical requests from teachers?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nSo there you see this big movement bubbling up on social media under the hashtag #14daysnonewcases. And this is really quite a radical demand for schools not to reopen physically until there are no new cases in a region for 14 days. Now many nations have been able to reopen their schools safely without achieving that standard. And when I\u2019ve spoken to public health experts about this, what they say is, you know, \u201c14 days no new cases\u201d is not just a controlled pandemic, it\u2019s essentially the end of the pandemic in that region. And it might require a vaccine to get to that standard. Not just a vaccine that exists and works, but that has actually been deployed widely. When will that occur? Will that occur six months from now, 12 months from now, two years from now? We just don\u2019t know the answer to that. And those start to be very big numbers when you\u2019re thinking about children being out of school.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder what these demands from teachers look like to parents in this moment. I mean, I\u2019m mindful that many parents want their kids to return to school for a variety of very understandable reasons.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThat\u2019s right. I mean, I think the really hard thing is that there is no consensus or even strong majority opinion among parents. One recent national poll found about 60 percent of parents at this moment believe it\u2019s smarter to delay reopening physical schools until the virus subsides somewhat and there are more safety measures in place. But in some big cities, where the virus has been relatively well-controlled, like New York and Chicago, polls have found that a majority of families do have some willingness to send their kids back to school. And to add another layer of complication, it tends to be parents of color and low income parents that are the most scared of the health threats to their children of congregating in school buildings. But those families are also the most concerned about their kids falling back socially and academically because schools are closed. So there is just no consensus among parents as to what they feel is safe. It would in some ways be easier if American parents all agreed with each other about what was right here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMhm. And of course in the absence of physically returning to schools, we\u2019re left with online learning. And we have covered on the show the problems with how teachers and school districts are approaching that.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYeah. So in the spring, only a small segment of American school districts actually required teachers to teach live lessons over something like Zoom video. And here I think there is actually more risk of tension between parents and teachers. Because we\u2019re starting to see from polls what parents are asking for in a situation of continued remote learning. They were not happy that in the spring, many of their kids did not see teachers live over video. Many teachers were interacting with their students primarily over email at sort of random times per day. And that\u2019s not what parents want. They want their students to log on at very specific times and be in something like an online class, where they would have small group breakout sessions and discussions and have the opportunity to ask the teacher questions and get individualized feedback. And teachers unions are still, in some cases, resisting some of these practices, including even showing their faces on live video.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Dana, why would that be? I guess I\u2019m confused. If teachers are deeply reluctant to return to schools for very understandable reasons that you just outlined, and they don\u2019t feel school districts are meeting them halfway, why would they simultaneously be resisting a more enriched online remote teaching experience?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWell, some of them make the argument that it\u2019s not fair to provide too much live instruction, because students who don\u2019t have an adult to supervise their online learning at home, say, at exactly 10:00 a.m., might just miss out on the live lesson. So they think that that mode of education is not effective. But I\u2019ve also heard some arguments much simpler than that, that they don\u2019t want their homes to be shown. They\u2019re not comfortable in that medium. And they believe it\u2019s a violation of their own privacy to be shown from home in that way. So it\u2019s a range of different arguments there.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat would seem to raise a real crisis. I mean, teachers both not wanting to be in classrooms, but also not wanting to teach online the way parents want them to.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWell, this has been the sort of crux of these very tense latest negotiations across the country between teachers and school district leaders.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDana, I know a bunch of school districts around the country have actually started classes in schools. And I wonder how that has played out.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nWell, there have been some horror stories, unfortunately.\n\narchived recording In Georgia, this photo of a crowded hallway, no mask in sight, from North Paulding High School went viral after the school opened for in-person learning on August 3.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nYou know, for one of the first school districts to reopen, which was in Georgia, hundreds of staff were told to stay home because of potential exposure to the virus.\n\narchived recording Today the school remain closed, a week after that reopening.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nIn Indiana \u2014\n\narchived recording One student at Greenfield Central Junior High tested positive on the very first day of school.\n\ndana goldstein\n\n\u2014 right away this junior high school was having to call teachers and call students\u2019 families and ask them to stay home for two weeks.\n\narchived recording Students at Elwood Junior Senior High now have to go remote after staff members there tested positive for Covid-19.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nNow that\u2019s extremely alarming. But I want to say that nobody who\u2019s a public health or education expert believes that we\u2019re going to reopen schools without students and teachers showing up from time to time positive for Covid-19. That\u2019s not a realistic expectation. But what we do need is procedures in place to deal with that when it happens. I mean, it needs to be clear who is getting told to stay home for two weeks. And, is their access to testing for anyone who came in contact with that positive individual? So in many ways, I think these anecdotes that we\u2019re hearing of kind of first-day-back crises in towns and cities that are trying to reopen physically do show that many of the concerns that teachers have brought to the table here are quite legitimate.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo those are a small number of districts that have already reopened. But of course, many of the nation\u2019s largest school districts \u2014 Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., among others, are now firmly saying that they will not physically reopen schools at least initially. And that represents millions of students. So do teachers unions and teachers see that as a kind of victory?\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThey do see it as a victory, absolutely. They believe that it\u2019s not only what\u2019s necessary to protect their health but to prevent schools emerging as potential hot spots for spreading Covid-19. But I think within that victory, there is also a real tragedy for American children and actually for our country. Because to be in a place where the needs of public health and safety are really juxtaposed against our ability to fully educate our kids, is to be in a place that very few other developed nations are in right now. And it is because of our failure to control the pandemic itself. We are looking at the real likelihood that millions or tens of millions of children do not attend school for an entire year. A full year of no school. And we just know that it\u2019s going to lead to big problems. It\u2019s going to make kids less likely to learn to read. It\u2019s going to probably lead to higher high school dropout rates. It\u2019s going to lead to students who don\u2019t have enough to eat, because school is where they are fed. And to students that don\u2019t have access to the mental health counseling and the special education services that they get at schools. So the fact that we\u2019re having to choose between everything crucial that the physical school provides and public health, it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s stunning to me as a 15-year veteran on the education beat and just also as a parent. You know, my daughter is going to come through this pandemic just fine. She has access to a great childcare and we have a lot of resources in our home and family to bring her through this. But still, it\u2019s really sad for our family that she\u2019s missing the preschool experience that we really wanted her to have. It\u2019s been months since she was with teachers and socializing with a group of students. And she\u2019s started even to become more timid around other kids, we\u2019ve noticed when we do take those walks out to the playground. And you know, it\u2019s sad for our family. And it\u2019s just a tiny microcosm of how sad it is for our country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDana, thank you very much.\n\ndana goldstein\n\nThank you so much, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nStarting this week, several Florida school districts began holding in-person classes, even as the lawsuit filed by the state\u2019s teachers union moves ahead.

As interest rates fell, they refinanced their home, taking out cash in the process to supplement their savings so they could start the work immediately.\n\nBefore the pandemic, they figured they would renovate the kitchen, which is small, but in good condition. Their architect steered them away from that idea, Ms. Meehan said, suggesting that by expanding the dining and living areas, they could leave the kitchen intact, but it would nonetheless feel larger. By avoiding a kitchen remodel, most of the work can be done outside of the footprint of the existing house, allowing the family to continue to live at home with only minimal contact with the work crew.\n\n\u201cObviously there\u2019s a different level of concern with Covid, not wanting contractors in your house,\u201d Ms. Meehan said. \u201cThat sold us on doing the renovation.\u201d\n\nNo More Room Inside? Consider a Shed\n\nSome homeowners are looking to their backyards for additional space, adding customizable sheds to use as offices, classrooms or workout studios. Such structures, which can be assembled quickly on site, avoid the stress, time commitment and high cost of an interior renovation. Sales in May 2020 were up 500 percent from May 2019 for Studio Shed, a Colorado-based company that sells customizable backyard shed solutions ranging from simple storage spaces to elaborate tiny cabins with gabled roofs, double-pane windows and sustainable lumber. Most orders, said Studio Shed\u2019s founder, Mike Koenig, are for home office spaces. Man caves and \u201cshe sheds\u201d are also popular, as are music studios and so-called flex spaces, which could work as a spare guest room, play space or home gym.", "Still, I worried. But once I made the decision, everything was fine.\n\nEvery day, before school, I checked Tae-yeon\u2019s temperature and health conditions and submitted the results online using a government app. A kid whose temperature was above 37 degrees Celsius, or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, was not allowed to go to school. Kids who may have crossed paths with a person who tested positive were told not to come to school until they were tested and quarantined for 14 days.\n\nAnti-droplet glass partitions were installed at each kid\u2019s desk. Tae-yeon ate lunch at her desk. She said that even with the partitions, she could talk to her friends during lunch time.\n\nI did wonder why I was sending Tae-yeon back to school when I learned that she hardly got to speak to her classmates and basically listened to lectures by her teacher. She told me that kids took turns reading a book aloud \u2014 with their masks on \u2014 but otherwise kept silent.\n\nAfter all, she was only in second grade and I don\u2019t expect much academic development from offline school. I mean, the contents of online classes the government offers are pretty good, in my opinion. So in a way, sending Tae-yeon to school during this scary time of coronavirus, with all the restrictions, can be a hassle.\n\nStill, I wanted to let Tae-yeon continue experiencing what it was like to be in a peer community; to be a regular student routinely sitting at a desk and listening to the teacher; and to mingle with other kids, if only for brief moments. When I waited outside the school gate to pick her up at 12:30 p.m., I would see her talking to her friends as she walked toward me with her mask on.

Epidemiologists wonder whether intensive contact tracing on the reservation enabled teams to find and treat gravely ill people before it was too late to save them.\n\nContact tracing is generally used to identify and isolate the infected, and to slow the spread of the virus. Elsewhere in the United States, the strategy is largely failing as tracers struggle to keep up with widespread infections.\n\nBut on the reservation, contact tracers \u2014 equipped with oximeters, to detect low blood oxygen levels in people who often didn\u2019t realize they were seriously ill \u2014 have discovered effective new tactics as they trek from home to faraway home.\n\nExperts suggest that their approach may offer a new strategy for reducing deaths in some of the hardest-hit communities, especially among those in housing where multiple generations share space.\n\nDr. Vincent Marconi, the director of infectious diseases research at Emory University in Atlanta, said it was \u201cincredible\u201d that contact tracing could have such an effect on a population so disadvantaged and at such high risk.\n\nIf the reservation\u2019s methods have lowered death rates, he added, \u201cthen absolutely, without a doubt, this needs to be replicated elsewhere.\u201d", "\u201cI have been in Phase 1 since March,\u201d said Kate Pierson, an original member of the inimitable new-wave band the B-52\u2019s, who has run Kate\u2019s Lazy Meadow, a rustic, funky getaway in Mount Tremper, New York, with her wife, Monica Coleman, an artist, since 2004.

If you\u2019re having an urgent health crisis \u2014 mental or physical \u2014 say so and ask for advice; if it\u2019s after hours, you\u2019ll talk to an answering service who will have the doctor call you back to discuss next steps \u2014 going to the emergency room, for example.\n\nAnd a plea from Dr. Talib: \u201cIf my teen patients would actually cancel appointments, I would love that so much \u2014 they just don\u2019t show up.\u201d Plus, you can be charged for a missed appointment that you don\u2019t cancel.\n\nDaunted?

If you worry that your teen might be experiencing depression or suicidal thoughts, there are a few things you can do to help. Dr. Christine Moutier, the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suggests these steps: Look for changes. Notice shifts in sleeping and eating habits in your teen, as well as any issues he or she might be having at school, such as slipping grades. Watch for angry outbursts, mood swings and a loss of interest in activities they used to love. Stay attuned to their social media posts as well. Keep the lines of communication open. If you notice something unusual, start a conversation. But your child might not want to talk. In that case, offer him or her help in finding a trusted person to share their struggles with instead. Seek out professional support. A child who expresses suicidal thoughts may benefit from a mental health evaluation and treatment. You can start by speaking with your child\u2019s pediatrician or a mental health professional. In an emergency: If you have immediate concern for your child\u2019s safety, do not leave him or her alone. Call a suicide prevention lifeline. Lock up any potentially lethal objects. Children who are actively trying to harm themselves should be taken to the closest emergency room. Resources If you\u2019re worried about someone in your life and don\u2019t know how to help, these resources can offer guidance:1. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) 2.

And make sure to build in plenty of lead time; you don\u2019t want to end up in the E.R. simply because you, say, forgot to pick up your inhaler.\n\nAny questions? Ask the pharmacist.

Some children \u2014 and adolescents \u2014 may actually be getting more sleep, or better sleep, while others are struggling with disrupted routines, anxiety and electronics, sometimes all at the same time. And even for those who have settled into new schedules that leave them reasonably well rested, back-to-school season may mean a possibly problematic reset.\n\nTwo sleep specialists, in Cincinnati and London, published an editorial, \u201cPerils and promise for child and adolescent sleep and associated psychopathology during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d at the end of May in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Stephen P. Becker and Alice M. Gregory discussed possible impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on children\u2019s sleep, arguing that because of the importance of sleep for many aspects of children\u2019s well-being, ranging from mental health to immunological well-being and disease resistance, it would be important to look closely at how sleep might be changing, for children and for adolescents, at whether those changes are problematic when children have to return to school, and at which factors are associated with better \u2014 and worse \u2014 sleep.\n\nIn a study published in late July in the Journal of Sleep Research, researchers looked at how 1,619 children in China were doing in terms of sleep. The children, ages 4, 5 and 6, were recruited from 11 preschools in the province of Guizhou, in the city of Zunyi, about 650 miles from Wuhan. Parents and caregivers completed a questionnaire about how the children were sleeping during their time \u201csheltering at home\u201d in February, after the children had been confined at home for nearly a month. The reported sleep patterns were compared to a similar group in 2018.\n\nDr. Zhijun Liu, an associate professor in the department of applied psychology at Zunyi Medical University who was the lead author on the study, said in an email that the expectation had been that the confinement would have a negative effect on children\u2019s sleep: \u201cHere in China, most families underwent days of confinement to cope with the pandemic, which means much less outdoor activities, less face-to-face interpersonal communications and even less sunlight for some of them than usual.\u201d Both parents and children spent more time on electronic devices and less time moving around.

He said that assimilating to a society he found to be rife with racism and issues of identity constituted culture shock, particularly as a father and high school science teacher to mostly Black public school students. Albert said he found the educational system in New York \u201cdemeaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter being in the school system, watching the young Black men, inspiring them, talking to them, seeing their issues,\u201d Albert said he decided to create his own curriculum.\n\nHe founded the Light and Peace Learning Center, a home-school collective in Brooklyn in 2013.\n\nAlbert said he was not satisfied with the curriculum and the disciplinary model at the public school that his then 5-year-old son attended, so he pulled him out. It was crucial to Albert that his son be exposed to the kind of positive, pro-Black and African-based curriculum that he had grown up with as a child.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Light and Peace, run cooperatively with about 15 other families at its height, offered the kind of teaching he felt was sorely missing from neighborhood schools. \u201cI would plan classes and teach them from an African perspective,\u201d Albert said. The collective offered languages such as Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, and Kemetic yoga, from ancient Egypt. The collective, he said, \u201cfocused more on the ideology of kinship and origin from creation from Africa, and knowing history from there.\u201d\n\nBefore making the transition to remote learning because of the pandemic, Light and Peace ran its collective out of a building in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the students would gather every day for instruction that Albert had planned. Albert, some parents of the students and members of the community taught the lessons and shared their knowledge or special skills, such as African dance and creative writing. He also offered after-school homework help for children in the community who attended other schools nearby. Along with activities like martial arts and chess, Light and Peace also ran a daily \u201ceco-adventures\u201d summer camp in which Albert would take students and parents on botanical tours of the city, where students would learn to identify different plant species.\n\nNow, Light and Peace is run exclusively online. Albert tutors and teaches chess to the kids.

Albert moved to New Jersey in 2018 and is pursuing a doctoral degree in education leadership at North Central University. His graduate course load has required him to step away from teaching full time, he said. He still works with four students online, in addition to teaching his own six children, whose ages range from 2 to 11.\n\nMost of the families learned about the Light and Peace collective because they were already connected to Albert in some way, either as a friend or a friend of a friend. \u201cIt was more like a personal type of home-schooling collective,\u201d Albert said. \u201cBecause my children were involved, I kept it real personal.\u201d", "Ana Morales Becerra, a single mom from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, once described her former home as a calm place in the middle of a cartel war.

Gregory discussed possible impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on children\u2019s sleep, arguing that because of the importance of sleep for many aspects of children\u2019s well-being, ranging from mental health to immunological well-being and disease resistance, it would be important to look closely at how sleep might be changing, for children and for adolescents, at whether those changes are problematic when children have to return to school, and at which factors are associated with better \u2014 and worse \u2014 sleep.\n\nIn a study published in late July in the Journal of Sleep Research, researchers looked at how 1,619 children in China were doing in terms of sleep. The children, ages 4, 5 and 6, were recruited from 11 preschools in the province of Guizhou, in the city of Zunyi, about 650 miles from Wuhan. Parents and caregivers completed a questionnaire about how the children were sleeping during their time \u201csheltering at home\u201d in February, after the children had been confined at home for nearly a month. The reported sleep patterns were compared to a similar group in 2018.\n\nDr. Zhijun Liu, an associate professor in the department of applied psychology at Zunyi Medical University who was the lead author on the study, said in an email that the expectation had been that the confinement would have a negative effect on children\u2019s sleep: \u201cHere in China, most families underwent days of confinement to cope with the pandemic, which means much less outdoor activities, less face-to-face interpersonal communications and even less sunlight for some of them than usual.\u201d Both parents and children spent more time on electronic devices and less time moving around. He continued, \u201cLiving in a limited room is usually no good for one\u2019s mood either.\u201d", "That may be part of what led the director Alex Ross Perry to ask Bognanno to write songs for his gritty 2018 rock-star flick \u201cHer Smell,\u201d with Elisabeth Moss playing a Love-like lead singer. Bognanno sent close-up videos of her hands on the fret board to Moss, who practiced the songs with a teacher. \u201cShe did a fantastic job, but I think it was good for me to not have total control,\u201d Bognanno said. It became one of the many opportunities she has had over the past few years to practice letting go.\n\nZooming on a recent afternoon from her Nashville home, where strings of white Christmas lights and scattered guitars hung vertically throughout a cozy living room, Bognanno spoke quietly enough not to disturb the two dogs sleeping soundly behind her. Her mop of unruly bleached hair fell around her shoulders as she admitted that the prospect of releasing a new album without being able to immediately hit the road and play live had, just the night before, brought on a mild existential crisis.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t even know who I am without touring!\u201d\n\nCompounding the stress is the fact that Bully\u2019s third album, \u201cSugaregg,\u201d crystallizes a few major changes. It is the first record since Bognanno parted ways with her former band members and recalibrated Bully as a solo project. It\u2019s the first Bully record she hasn\u2019t engineered herself. And it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s written frankly or spoken frankly about her struggles with bipolar II disorder.\n\n\u201cBeing able to get a better grasp on that just rebuilds you,\u201d Bognanno said, squeezing a slime-green stress ball in one palm. \u201cI just felt like a shell of myself for a very long time and getting that back was the best feeling ever and opened up so many doors for me with my writing.\u201d"], "20200818": ["Originally from St. Lucia, Albert grew up in an Afro-centric, majority Black educational system, which made his move to the United States in 2001 and enrollment in master\u2019s program in education at New York University much more difficult than he had anticipated. He said that assimilating to a society he found to be rife with racism and issues of identity constituted culture shock, particularly as a father and high school science teacher to mostly Black public school students. Albert said he found the educational system in New York \u201cdemeaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter being in the school system, watching the young Black men, inspiring them, talking to them, seeing their issues,\u201d Albert said he decided to create his own curriculum.\n\nHe founded the Light and Peace Learning Center, a home-school collective in Brooklyn in 2013.\n\nAlbert said he was not satisfied with the curriculum and the disciplinary model at the public school that his then 5-year-old son attended, so he pulled him out. It was crucial to Albert that his son be exposed to the kind of positive, pro-Black and African-based curriculum that he had grown up with as a child.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Light and Peace, run cooperatively with about 15 other families at its height, offered the kind of teaching he felt was sorely missing from neighborhood schools. \u201cI would plan classes and teach them from an African perspective,\u201d Albert said. The collective offered languages such as Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, and Kemetic yoga, from ancient Egypt. The collective, he said, \u201cfocused more on the ideology of kinship and origin from creation from Africa, and knowing history from there.\u201d\n\nBefore making the transition to remote learning because of the pandemic, Light and Peace ran its collective out of a building in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the students would gather every day for instruction that Albert had planned. Albert, some parents of the students and members of the community taught the lessons and shared their knowledge or special skills, such as African dance and creative writing. He also offered after-school homework help for children in the community who attended other schools nearby. Along with activities like martial arts and chess, Light and Peace also ran a daily \u201ceco-adventures\u201d summer camp in which Albert would take students and parents on botanical tours of the city, where students would learn to identify different plant species.\n\nNow, Light and Peace is run exclusively online. Albert tutors and teaches chess to the kids. But the collective mostly serves as a resource for parents, offering them webinars on how to effectively develop their own academic curriculum and how to work with local community organizations to enrich the children\u2019s learning at home. Albert moved to New Jersey in 2018 and is pursuing a doctoral degree in education leadership at North Central University. His graduate course load has required him to step away from teaching full time, he said. He still works with four students online, in addition to teaching his own six children, whose ages range from 2 to 11.\n\nMost of the families learned about the Light and Peace collective because they were already connected to Albert in some way, either as a friend or a friend of a friend. \u201cIt was more like a personal type of home-schooling collective,\u201d Albert said. \u201cBecause my children were involved, I kept it real personal.\u201d", "Ana Morales Becerra, a single mom from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, once described her former home as a calm place in the middle of a cartel war. With so many narcos in her neighborhood, in the city of Uruapan, she felt sure that no one would dare to come in to rob her. But still, she always felt uneasy as her daily routine \u2014 working two jobs and taking care of her kids \u2014 was punctuated with trucks full of armed people passing by.\n\nThe tipping point came, however, when narco trucks started following her children. \u201cNo more!\u201d she remembers saying. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Fleeing cartel violence, sexual abuse and death threats, she left her home to seek a fresh start in the United States. Last October, she arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, with her four children, very little money and no place to stay.\n\nBut seeking asylum, which Morales Becerra thought would be a relatively fast process, turned out to be an administrative tar pit that would strand her and her family for months while they waited for a judge to decide their fate. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we would have to go through all this process,\u201d she said.

With few good options for support, the vast majority have resigned themselves to going it alone, a new survey for The New York Times has found.\n\nJust one in seven parents said their children would be returning to school full time this fall, and for most children, remote school requires hands-on help from an adult at home. Yet four in five parents said they would have no in-person help educating and caring for them, whether from relatives, neighbors, nannies or tutors, according to the survey, administered by Morning Consult. And more than half of parents will be taking on this second, unpaid job at the same time they\u2019re holding down paid work.\n\nRaising children has always been a community endeavor, and suddenly the village that parents relied on is gone. It\u2019s taking a toll on parents\u2019 careers, families\u2019 well-being and children\u2019s education.\n\nIn families where both wage earners need to work outside the home, parents have obvious logistical challenges because they cannot be in two places at once.

Be happy.\u201d\n\nThe call came, and the news: Our older daughter, Molly Jane, 26, who has lived in Russia since she went to graduate school there four years ago, was engaged to marry her current boyfriend, Pavel Shushkov, known as Pasha, whom she had been dating for a little over a year and a half. The wedding was set for the Fourth of July in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nWas I happy?\n\nNow, in my completely objective opinion, Molly, who works as an editor for an online news service that covers cryptocurrency, is brilliant and beautiful and generally wonderful in all ways (as is \u2014 odd coincidence \u2014 her sister) and has delighted me and enriched my life since the day she was born. It had occasionally crossed my mind that my daughters might someday marry, but who would be worthy of them? A Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist? A Google millionaire genius? Doubtful. Somehow, it had never occurred to me to put \u201c32-year-old Russian pet-food wholesaler\u201d on the list.\n\nWe had met Pasha.

Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American, and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can\u2019t win you over with their policies. So they\u2019re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.\u201d \u201cWith only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I hereby declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic candidate for vice president.\u201d \u201cShe is the first black woman, first South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.\u201d \u201cThis is a historic pick.\u201d \u201cSomeone who looks like us on a presidential ticket, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u201cThat I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all.

Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting long after its ratification. But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight, but I know she\u2019s looking down on me from above.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Early in the pandemic, nursing homes, jails and meatpacking plants were the sites of coronavirus outbreaks across the country. Now, as some students have returned to campuses for the fall semester, the new hot spots are colleges and universities. My colleague, Natasha Singer, has the story of one school and one student. It\u2019s Wednesday, September 16. So Natasha, tell me how you came to find Zoie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in August, we started receiving what I would call these S.O.S. messages from students at universities. And we got these messages because we have a system called Tip Jar, where readers who want to be whistleblowers or who just have complaints or who want to give us tips about things to look into can write to us anonymously. So these messages started coming from different campuses of college students who were sequestered in these special dorms for students who test positive for coronavirus. And they were describing being kind of trapped in these filthy conditions, in quarantine dorms with, like, dead bugs and mold in the walls, and, like, leaking bathrooms. But also, they felt like they\u2019d been abandoned. That the university had sort of cut them off to keep them from being contagious and infecting anybody else and then forgotten about them.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) Good morning, TikTok. So I\u2019m quarantined in my N.Y.U. dorm room for two weeks, and I can\u2019t leave. And they bring us meals every day.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so I decided I would try to find some students who were in quarantine and isolation on college campuses.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) It\u2019s 11:15. And I just got my breakfast. So let\u2019s see what it is. Because so far the food has been questionable.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd I looked at TikTok, because we\u2019d been seeing all these videos of kids on TikTok complaining about bad meals.\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) For breakfast that was delivered at 12:30 \u2014 warm grape juice.

Because it is currently 2:00 p.m. And they have not fed me all day. tiktok clip (college student 2) We were given almost no supplies. We were given no food, no masks, no gloves, no microwave, no bed sheets, no soap, no cleaning supplies. Nothing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd while I was looking at students who were more concerned \u2014\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) N.Y.U., I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings. Please feed me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\n\u2014 I saw videos by this student at the University of Alabama.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Hey, y\u2019all. This is day one of quarantine. I found out today that I have Covid and now my university has sent me to a small apartment by myself for 14 days.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd her name is Zoie Terry. And she was just documenting her experience being isolated in this dorm by herself.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) OK. I\u2019m not going to lie. This apartment is kind of scary. But we\u2019re just going to go with it. They also gave three waters. I\u2019ll keep you all updated on how I\u2019m doing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she was upbeat. And she has this huge smile. And she\u2019s completely charming. But the conditions behind her were very bleak, it seemed. So I went to the University of Alabama directory and I looked up every student named Zoie.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then, you know, I found this Zoie. And I just sent her an email saying, you know, I\u2019d like to know what it\u2019s like. I want to know what your experience was like in that isolation dorm.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd who is Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nZoie is a sophomore at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\n\nzoie terry My name is Zoie Terry. I\u2019m 19 years old. I am from Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so last year, she joined a sorority. And she was living, you know, in a freshman dorm and looking forward to the fall. But right before spring break, the coronavirus began to spread.\n\nzoie terry And then once I went home, within the hour of being home, they emailed us and told us that we weren\u2019t coming back.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd they never came back to school. Because the coronavirus shut down the campus.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did you feel about that, when that happened? zoie terry I was very upset. Me and all my friends were kind of devastated. Because we were just getting into the hang of college life. But I kind of was more freaked out because I didn\u2019t know, like, if I need to start getting my stuff ready at home to be living at home, or anything like that. Because my mom lived in a two-bedroom apartment with my twin brother and her.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she stayed at home with her mom. And they, you know, kind of banded together to wait this out.\n\nzoie terry I convinced my mom to let me get a dog. And that was kind of all I did the entire quarantine. I just watched my dog grow up, basically.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what\u2019s the status of Zoie\u2019s sophomore year? Is the university making plans to reopen?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in June, Kay Ivey, who\u2019s the governor of Alabama, announced this incredibly ambitious program to reopen the public colleges and universities in the entire state. And she puts up federal money, $30 million from, like, federal emergency coronavirus response funds to create this program to test every single student returning to college in Alabama for coronavirus before they get to school. And that could be, you know, 150,000 students.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd how are they going to do that? We keep reading about all the shortages in testing. How are you going to test over 150,000 students?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nIt\u2019s actually a fascinating story because one of the University of Alabama schools \u2014 the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2014 is a major academic medical center and has a major medical school. The governor asked the University of Alabama at Birmingham to take on this colossal testing of every returning college student. And so they ramped up their capacity to test. And they ramped up to be able to process 10 to 12,000 student coronavirus tests a day. They also set up this kind of military level logistics, where they opened 13 coronavirus testing sites for students around the state. And students had to be tested up to two weeks before they returned to campus. And the University of Alabama president and others, as they were describing this, promised that they would be the safest campuses in America when these Alabama schools reopened.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so during the summer, while all these students are getting tested, where is Alabama in terms of infections?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo by August, when the University of Alabama was gearing up to reopen, Alabama had the seventh highest per capita infection rate in the United States.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it was a calculated risk. But they felt their program was comprehensive and that they would be able to safely reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what about Zoie? Is she feeling like this is a risk?\n\nzoie terry I guess a couple weeks before school started, I was like, I felt more comfortable with the idea of going back to school, because everybody had to get tested before they even were allowed to return on campus.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo for Zoie to go back to school, she also had to get one of these tests that every other college student in Alabama was going to take.\n\nzoie terry And it came back negative. So I was allowed to come to school.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she comes back to school early before classes start, because she is going to participate in sorority rush and help interview and identify the first-year students, the girls who are going to be part of the sorority and move into the house next year.\n\nzoie terry So coming back, it was super strange. And everything looked so different because just social distancing and everything like that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYou know, usually this is a really festive, social, in-person gathering. And now they have to do rush online. They have to interview prospective sorority members virtually. But they still are putting a huge amount of energy into this. And Zoie is staying up late. And then she\u2019s waking up really, really early to help organize the rush and interview the prospective students.\n\nzoie terry And so when you have lack of sleep, you kind of start to feel a little sick. You know what I mean? But I was thinking, there was no way I could have had the virus. Because I was following every guideline. I was doing nothing. I was in my room 24/7. And so a day or two went by, and my body just felt so weak and so feverish. And I call my mom. And she\u2019s, like, you need to go get tested, just to make sure.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she gets an appointment to be tested that day. And she goes down to student health services. And she has a coronavirus test.\n\nzoie terry And it told me that I was positive. archived recording (natasha singer) And then what did you do? zoie terry So I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do. Because it was very new. So basically, I had to contact the University of Alabama Covid-19 hotline. And, like, there\u2019s a button where it\u2019s like, if you think you may have Covid, press this. If you\u2019re calling for positive test results, press this. So then I pressed that and I was assigned a case manager. And we just \u2014 she talked to me on the phone. I was having a little bit of a meltdown. I was, like, crying and hyperventilating. And she was like, are you OK? Like, I know this is so scary. But you are going to be OK, I promise you. We\u2019re going to get through this. And I will tell you exactly what to do. And I was, like OK, like, thank you so much. And I was, like, trying to calm myself down on the other side of the line. But \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she gets this email saying to her, you\u2019re going to move to this place. And there\u2019s going to be a lockbox with your key.\n\nzoie terry So I just packed all my clothes and stuff. I packed my TV. And, like, I packed my essential oil diffuser and, like, fun things like that. And try to make it as homey as possible, because I was going to be very homesick, I knew.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she gets the key. And she goes there and she opens the door. And it\u2019s kind of empty.\n\nzoie terry When I went there, there was nobody there. None of the lights were on in the buildings. And I was the only one quarantined in my apartment. I think they were just starting to quarantine people. So everything was very fresh and new to them. And \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThere\u2019s no toilet paper. And there\u2019s no, you know, sanitizer. And there\u2019s nobody to greet her, right? There\u2019s nobody from the university. There\u2019s no nurse. There\u2019s nobody in a mask. There\u2019s no security guard. There\u2019s nobody to escort her in and tell her what\u2019s going to happen and tell her who she can call. She\u2019s basically alone to fend for herself.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did that feel, going to this place by yourself? zoie terry Well, I have a lot of anxiety. So it was an experience, me first going there. And keep in mind, I also had corona. So I was very sick and very just \u2014 my emotions were very high. So I just remember I walked in, and I went straight to the furthest room, turned the lights on, shut the door. And I just sat there and started crying. I just cried for, like, five minutes. And then I pulled myself together. And I went and got my stuff from the car.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe calls her mom, who\u2019s a former I.C.U. nurse. And she calls her sister who works in New York. And she basically FaceTimes with them. And that is the beginning of what gets her through it.\n\nzoie terry So basically, my sister took what we called the day shift. First thing I would do when I wake up is call her. So I would have her on FaceTime the entire day. And my mom took the night shifts. So my mom would be on FaceTime with me throughout the night. She likes to say she monitored my breathing just in case something happened in the middle of the night where I passed out or something like that. She wanted to have my attention 24/7, in case I was like unresponsive or something. So \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBasically you were live streaming 24/7, 12 hours a day with your sister and 12 with your mom?\n\nzoie terry Yeah. I would have panic attacks. And I would think that I was, like, I couldn\u2019t breathe. But it was actually due to my anxiety and panic attacks. So I would, like, tell my mom what I was experiencing and what was happening with my health. And then she would let me know what to do from then on.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo how sick was Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe had a fever. She was exhausted. She had some breathing issues. Some of it was anxiety. But you know, it\u2019s hard to know. And so that is one of the reasons her mother wanted to monitor her. They also had a recent family tragedy. Zoie\u2019s father had a respiratory illness and he died last year. And so the fact the coronavirus was a respiratory illness, and that Zoie had it, also heightened the anxiety for the whole family and made her mom want to monitor her and act, you know, as the guardian. Because the university is not acting as a guardian of this sick student.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWhat\u2019s happening on campus as Zoie is locked in quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she really was one of the first students to go into this quarantine dorm. But as the days go by, coronavirus is spreading across campus. And so more cars are in the parking lot. A few students begin to move in. Right? And before she\u2019s moved out, there is an outbreak on campus. Kids have been going to parties without their mask on. They\u2019ve been gathering en masse in local bars in Tuscaloosa without masks on. And there is an explosion of virus cases.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Natasha, while Zoie\u2019s been in quarantine, the virus has really been taking off across campus?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYeah. And the story of how Zoie thinks she got coronavirus is indicative of how the outbreaks are spreading on campus.\n\nzoie terry The one night I had left my sorority house and had went and, like, interacted with friends, it was me and three other girls. And we had all ordered Chipotle to her house. And we all ate dinner together. And we watched a movie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she goes to call one of the friends who was at the dinner that night.\n\nzoie terry I was very nervous to call. I said, hey girl, what are you doing? And she was, like, she sounded really upset. And she goes, I\u2019m currently getting tested for Covid. And I was, like, really? That\u2019s so funny you say that. And before I could even finish my sentence, she goes, so and so has it in my house. So if you got it from this person, then I am so sorry. And I said, no, that\u2019s totally fine. I was actually calling you to tell you that I have tested positive for Covid, and that you need to get tested. And she goes, no, yeah, I\u2019m getting tested right now. So thank you for telling me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo it turned out that all the girls who were at the dinner that evening ended up getting coronavirus. And this was before classes had even started. So you can imagine how the virus started to spread as students were returning to campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo this extensive plan that the state had for testing, what went wrong?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThey tested tens of thousands of students before they came back to campus. But there was a really weak link in this testing protocol. And that was students had to be tested within two weeks of coming back to campus. But that means, like, you could test me two weeks before I go back to campus, and then I could go to a party and get Covid.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOr I might not know I have it, right, and you test me, and it takes four days to develop. And then I\u2019m going to bring my Covid with me to campus. And so there was a huge effort to do this testing. But I interviewed an epidemiologist who said it was kind of useless to test kids even a week out. And Alabama did its best. And I asked them why they used this two-week window. And they said, look, we are testing kids at scale. It was believed to be the largest student testing program in terms of higher ed anywhere in the country. And there was no way they could have processed all those 150,000 tests only two days before classes start. So they traded off getting everybody for, you know, in fact not doing it so close to the return.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo what is the situation on campus when Zoie gets out of quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo after 10 days, Zoie is finally free.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Guess what, you guys? I am done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe makes this jailbreak TikTok.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) And you might be asking yourself, Zoie, what is the first thing you do when you\u2019re free? And to that I say, I get Dunkin\u2019 with Linda!\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then she goes home to visit her mom and her dog.\n\nzoie terry And my dog \u2014 [LAUGHS] \u2014 he didn\u2019t really recognize it was me, though. It was kind of sad. Because I had the mask on \u2014 until I started speaking in my dog voice. Everybody has one. archived recording (natasha singer) Can you use your dog voice? zoie terry Oh, no. (IN DOG VOICE) I just talk like this to my Simon. He\u2019s very cute. I just talk like this to him. archived recording (natasha singer) It sounds like your own language. zoie terry He knows, he knows \u2014 if I were to say, \u201cSimon, come here\u201d in my normal voice, he wouldn\u2019t know that I was talking to him. But if I was, like, (IN DOG VOICE) \u201cSimon, come here,\u201d then he would know I was talking to him. archived recording (natasha singer) I love that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBy the time, Zoie gets back to campus, it\u2019s a completely different place. There are even more restrictions in place to try to get a handle on this virus outbreak on campus. Students are essentially confined to their room except for essential activities. They can\u2019t have any gatherings. They can\u2019t hang out in their dorms. They can\u2019t go to common spaces. The dining hall is closed except for takeout. And the bars in Tuscaloosa are closed for two weeks.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s very strange. Honestly, it\u2019s not very fun. I could be doing a way cheaper option of doing, like, a community college online instead of paying my tuition that I\u2019m paying right now.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she basically spends a lot of time in her room. The majority of her classes are now online except for one of them. And yet, she still wants to be there.\n\nzoie terry But also, I\u2019m here for like the education and the resources they have for the major I\u2019m in.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it really matters to her.\n\nzoie terry My mom and my dad both went here. And so that\u2019s why I mainly chose to come to school here, is because I am the last child out of 5 to go to college. And the only one to go to \u2018Bama. So it was kind of a given for me to come here. natasha singer So you\u2019re like the Roll Tide legacy? zoie terry Definitely. We are a big, big, big football fan family.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe\u2019s carrying on this major family tradition that is both educational and intellectual and social. And she wants to stick it out. And they all hope the university can pull this off.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s just kind of upsetting. Because my freshman year wasn\u2019t that great. Because I was just getting over the passing of my dad, and I was dealing with grief my entire freshman year. So I was kind of looking forward to my sophomore year thinking, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s going to be so much fun. Like, I\u2019m going to meet all these new people. And now that I\u2019m here and everything\u2019s happening with Covid, we can\u2019t have the sophomore year that everybody else has been able to have in years past. And I can\u2019t even imagine how the freshmen feel. I feel so bad for them. Because they\u2019re coming to college and, like, this isn\u2019t what college is like. Like, during rush, I was telling people, I was like, I promise this isn\u2019t what college is like. It\u2019s so much more fun this. And it\u2019s going to be OK. We\u2019re going to get through this. We just have to get over this hump. And once everything\u2019s better, hopefully we get a vaccine, and maybe one day things can go back to normal. But until then, we just gotta push through this time and hope for things to get better.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what is your understanding of why states and schools like the University of Alabama pushed to do this in the first place?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nI think that there are multiple factors that affect whether universities decided to reopen or not. And there are fascinating calculations that went on about what number or percent of students are going to get the virus, and what is an acceptable risk to take. And we see that some universities, even large state universities, made the decision that they were not going to reopen for in-person instruction. They were not going to bring students back to campus. Some of them made that decision for the semester and some said, look, we\u2019re going to spend the first six weeks online and we\u2019ll see what happens. And other universities made the calculation that it would be much better to reopen. It would be better for their financial interests and financial survival. It would be better for students who would have a much better experience. There\u2019s nothing that beats in-person interaction. They were going to, you know, cause education loss and emotional kind of growth loss by not opening.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nCan you explain the financial piece of that a little bit more, the financial calculation?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nRight. Well, universities obviously need tuition money and residential hall kind of dorm occupancy money and dining hall money to keep going. And yes, state schools get state money. But they also need revenue. And so there\u2019s a large financial calculation about, you know, are we going to not reopen and lose all that income? Or are we going to open and get some of that income? And are we going to open and get some of that income, knowing we\u2019re going to close, but at least we\u2019ll have reaped some of that? So there\u2019s a big picture financial driver behind deciding to reopen or not. And then there are financial decisions every step of the way. Like, OK, we\u2019re going to reopen. Are we going to reopen at full dorm occupancy and get all that money that we need for residential life? Or are we going to take a hit and actually say only freshmen and seniors can come back? And that will allow us to have only one student per room. And that will really reduce the risk, we hope, of spread of virus. But we\u2019re going to take a financial hit. And so we see universities making different calculations. Some have decided we\u2019re not going to test kids. We\u2019re only going to test kids for the virus if they show symptoms or if they\u2019ve been exposed. We see other universities, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and they have decided they\u2019re going to test every student twice a week. This is a major state university deciding the only way they can reopen safely is to test every student two times a week, week after week. Right? That is a financial calculation. They\u2019re going to spend that money because they\u2019re trying to buy down risk. And then there\u2019s the political calculation. If you are a Republican governor in a largely Republican state, where there is a debate over whether people should be required to wear masks or not, there might be other reasons why you decide that you should reopen. Because your constituents want you to reopen and your president wants you to reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd we saw Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, say recently that it is much more risky now for universities that have reopened and have large outbreaks to send students home, where they might spread the virus, than to keep them there. And so we\u2019re seeing universities that in a sense fostered virus outbreaks by reopening have to keep the virus outbreaks under control by keeping students on campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd Natasha, your reporting on what happened to Zoie and the University of Alabama first published a few days ago. What has happened since then?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOn the same day the story came out, about eight hours later, the president of the University of Alabama sent out this message to students and faculty and staff and parents. And what he said was that they were implementing these important new changes.\n\nnatasha singer Do you know that the university sent out an email after the story came out that they\u2019re going to change quarantine and isolation? zoie terry I did not know that. natasha singer Well, I\u2019m just going to read it to you. Because I got an email from the president of U Alabama today. zoie terry OK. natasha singer I\u2019m going to read it to you. OK. So: \u201cDear students, faculty, staff and parents, hoping your Labor Day weekend was safe and relaxing. I want to update you on Covid-19 steps we have implemented effective today. \u201cFor our students who test positive and prepare to move to campus isolation spaces, staffing and medical resources have been enhanced to ensure prompt communication and expanded services.\u201d zoie terry That\u2019s amazing. Wow, OK. That makes me so happy. natasha singer Congratulations, Zoie. You\u2019ve made the University of Alabama quarantine better. zoie terry Thank you. Oh, my gosh. That\u2019s so great. Oh, that makes me feel so much better. For people I know going into quarantine, and if I have to go into quarantine again, like later on this year? Oh, that makes me feel so much better. Thank you so much. I\u2019m super happy that I had a voice in all of this. Because at the beginning when I first went into quarantine, I just sat in that room and cried because I was like, nobody\u2019s going to hear my story about this at all. Nobody is going to know about this. And now that I actually have a voice and people are going to hear about this, I\u2019m super thankful.\n\n[music]\n\nmegan twohey\n\nIn the latest reports from the University of Alabama, more than 2,500 students and nearly 1,200 faculty and staff have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past month. But in recent days, the school reports that the virus is slowing. And on Monday, they announced they were easing some of the rules around the lockdown on campus. We\u2019ll be right back.

Corinna Olsen, from Oregon, has worked as a porn star, a bodybuilder and a professional embalmer. Ayla Stewart grew up in Las Vegas, and before becoming known online as \u201cWife with a Purpose,\u201d a Christian stay-at-home mother of six whose broadcasts spew hatred toward anyone whose life choices are different, she flirted with a feminist version of New Age culture that included pagan goddess worship and veganism. Lana Lokteff, once a self-described \u201cgrunge puppy\u201d from the Pacific Northwest, now lives in Charleston, S.C., where she and her Swedish husband run Red Ice, a popular website and radio show that promotes apocalyptic racist propaganda. In emphasizing the specificity of their stories, Darby also underscores that all three women made choices. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to acknowledge the rampant, persistent sexism of the far right while also giving women the credit they deserve. \u2026 We risk stripping them of responsibility when we suggest that the harm they do is merely a way of coping with their own oppression.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nAs we learn more about them, we learn how their choices evolved. Corinna left the movement and even became an F.B.I. informer after realizing that a group she belonged to was planning to commit mass murder. Ayla and Lana cooperated briefly with Darby\u2019s reporting before deciding she was a leftist, feminist journalist who couldn\u2019t be trusted to adequately portray their continuing commitment to the white supremacist cause. In showing that white nationalism is not monolithic, Darby stresses its supporters\u2019 agency \u2014 reminding us that those supporters could always choose to act differently, and sometimes do.\n\nWhat makes such different women vulnerable to the movement\u2019s hateful propaganda? Darby draws on familiar studies in behavioral science that show the importance of repetition: The more you hear something repeated with conviction, the harder it is to believe it isn\u2019t true. Smartly, Darby also suggests that \u201clife in contemporary America may be enough to incline a person toward conspiracism.\u201d This was true before the current administration. Few Americans know that other wealthy nations \u2014 not just Scandinavia! \u2014 take for granted what Americans are lacking: universal health care, paid sick leave, parental leave, guaranteed vacations and other benefits regarded in this country as privileges to be granted, or denied, at employers\u2019 whims. Even though few Americans know these benefits are elsewhere called rights, their absence creates anxiety, social instability and a floating resentment that can easily turn violent, especially in places where any 18-year-old can buy an assault weapon but not a bottle of beer.\n\nBut Darby doesn\u2019t succumb to the idea that white nationalism is the product of economic insecurity; the statistics are too clear. She quotes the political scientist Ashley Jardina, who found that most white nationalists \u201cown houses, have average incomes similar to most whites in the United States, are employed and identify as middle class.\u201d (We\u2019d prefer to believe that Nazism too was supported by poor and illiterate masses, but a high percentage of Nazi Party members in Germany had college degrees.)\n\nWhile all three of Darby\u2019s subjects were influenced by the lies they ingested on right-wing radio and websites, all three denied they hated the Black people, Jews or Latinos regularly vilified on such sites. Darby writes, \u201cWhite nationalists are posing a challenge: If other groups can rally around their history, why not white people?\u201d This is not a stupid question. Darby answers it by saying it promotes a false equivalence, \u201cshorn of context, nuance and power disparities. In theory, though, it\u2019s more effective from a P.R. standpoint than lynchings, cross burnings and slur-filled pamphlets.\u201d", "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Contracts are being doled out to family members.

Each day I watched Gov. Andrew Cuomo talk to \u201cus\u201d and clearly explain what was going on. He followed the science and was strong, clear and loving in his daily briefings. He was human in his presentation of the daily cases and showed empathy for the daily deaths."], "20200819": ["megan twohey\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Megan Twohey. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Early in the pandemic, nursing homes, jails and meatpacking plants were the sites of coronavirus outbreaks across the country. Now, as some students have returned to campuses for the fall semester, the new hot spots are colleges and universities. My colleague, Natasha Singer, has the story of one school and one student. It\u2019s Wednesday, September 16. So Natasha, tell me how you came to find Zoie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in August, we started receiving what I would call these S.O.S. messages from students at universities. And we got these messages because we have a system called Tip Jar, where readers who want to be whistleblowers or who just have complaints or who want to give us tips about things to look into can write to us anonymously. So these messages started coming from different campuses of college students who were sequestered in these special dorms for students who test positive for coronavirus. And they were describing being kind of trapped in these filthy conditions, in quarantine dorms with, like, dead bugs and mold in the walls, and, like, leaking bathrooms. But also, they felt like they\u2019d been abandoned. That the university had sort of cut them off to keep them from being contagious and infecting anybody else and then forgotten about them.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) Good morning, TikTok. So I\u2019m quarantined in my N.Y.U. dorm room for two weeks, and I can\u2019t leave. And they bring us meals every day.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so I decided I would try to find some students who were in quarantine and isolation on college campuses.\n\ntiktok clip (college student) It\u2019s 11:15. And I just got my breakfast. So let\u2019s see what it is. Because so far the food has been questionable.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd I looked at TikTok, because we\u2019d been seeing all these videos of kids on TikTok complaining about bad meals.\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) For breakfast that was delivered at 12:30 \u2014 warm grape juice. Mystery vegan muffin. Oat bar. An unripe orange. tiktok clip (college student 2) But is anyone else who goes to the University of Michigan just, like, what the [EXPLETIVE] is happening right now? And, like, terrified \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nIn addition to that, there were these students who were complaining about more profound things.\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) I think N.Y.U. saw my TikTok last night. Because it is currently 2:00 p.m. And they have not fed me all day. tiktok clip (college student 2) We were given almost no supplies. We were given no food, no masks, no gloves, no microwave, no bed sheets, no soap, no cleaning supplies. Nothing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd while I was looking at students who were more concerned \u2014\n\ntiktok clip (college student 1) N.Y.U., I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings. Please feed me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\n\u2014 I saw videos by this student at the University of Alabama.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Hey, y\u2019all. This is day one of quarantine. I found out today that I have Covid and now my university has sent me to a small apartment by myself for 14 days.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd her name is Zoie Terry. And she was just documenting her experience being isolated in this dorm by herself.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) OK. I\u2019m not going to lie. This apartment is kind of scary. But we\u2019re just going to go with it. They also gave three waters. I\u2019ll keep you all updated on how I\u2019m doing.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she was upbeat. And she has this huge smile. And she\u2019s completely charming. But the conditions behind her were very bleak, it seemed. So I went to the University of Alabama directory and I looked up every student named Zoie.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then, you know, I found this Zoie. And I just sent her an email saying, you know, I\u2019d like to know what it\u2019s like. I want to know what your experience was like in that isolation dorm.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd who is Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nZoie is a sophomore at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\n\nzoie terry My name is Zoie Terry. I\u2019m 19 years old. I am from Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so last year, she joined a sorority. And she was living, you know, in a freshman dorm and looking forward to the fall. But right before spring break, the coronavirus began to spread.\n\nzoie terry And then once I went home, within the hour of being home, they emailed us and told us that we weren\u2019t coming back.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd they never came back to school. Because the coronavirus shut down the campus.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did you feel about that, when that happened? zoie terry I was very upset. Me and all my friends were kind of devastated. Because we were just getting into the hang of college life. But I kind of was more freaked out because I didn\u2019t know, like, if I need to start getting my stuff ready at home to be living at home, or anything like that. Because my mom lived in a two-bedroom apartment with my twin brother and her.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she stayed at home with her mom. And they, you know, kind of banded together to wait this out.\n\nzoie terry I convinced my mom to let me get a dog. And that was kind of all I did the entire quarantine. I just watched my dog grow up, basically.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what\u2019s the status of Zoie\u2019s sophomore year? Is the university making plans to reopen?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo in June, Kay Ivey, who\u2019s the governor of Alabama, announced this incredibly ambitious program to reopen the public colleges and universities in the entire state. And she puts up federal money, $30 million from, like, federal emergency coronavirus response funds to create this program to test every single student returning to college in Alabama for coronavirus before they get to school. And that could be, you know, 150,000 students.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd how are they going to do that? We keep reading about all the shortages in testing. How are you going to test over 150,000 students?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nIt\u2019s actually a fascinating story because one of the University of Alabama schools \u2014 the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2014 is a major academic medical center and has a major medical school. The governor asked the University of Alabama at Birmingham to take on this colossal testing of every returning college student. And so they ramped up their capacity to test. And they ramped up to be able to process 10 to 12,000 student coronavirus tests a day. They also set up this kind of military level logistics, where they opened 13 coronavirus testing sites for students around the state. And students had to be tested up to two weeks before they returned to campus. And the University of Alabama president and others, as they were describing this, promised that they would be the safest campuses in America when these Alabama schools reopened.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd so during the summer, while all these students are getting tested, where is Alabama in terms of infections?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo by August, when the University of Alabama was gearing up to reopen, Alabama had the seventh highest per capita infection rate in the United States.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWow.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it was a calculated risk. But they felt their program was comprehensive and that they would be able to safely reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what about Zoie? Is she feeling like this is a risk?\n\nzoie terry I guess a couple weeks before school started, I was like, I felt more comfortable with the idea of going back to school, because everybody had to get tested before they even were allowed to return on campus.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo for Zoie to go back to school, she also had to get one of these tests that every other college student in Alabama was going to take.\n\nzoie terry And it came back negative. So I was allowed to come to school.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she comes back to school early before classes start, because she is going to participate in sorority rush and help interview and identify the first-year students, the girls who are going to be part of the sorority and move into the house next year.\n\nzoie terry So coming back, it was super strange. And everything looked so different because just social distancing and everything like that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYou know, usually this is a really festive, social, in-person gathering. And now they have to do rush online. They have to interview prospective sorority members virtually. But they still are putting a huge amount of energy into this. And Zoie is staying up late. And then she\u2019s waking up really, really early to help organize the rush and interview the prospective students.\n\nzoie terry And so when you have lack of sleep, you kind of start to feel a little sick. You know what I mean? But I was thinking, there was no way I could have had the virus. Because I was following every guideline. I was doing nothing. I was in my room 24/7. And so a day or two went by, and my body just felt so weak and so feverish. And I call my mom. And she\u2019s, like, you need to go get tested, just to make sure.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she gets an appointment to be tested that day. And she goes down to student health services. And she has a coronavirus test.\n\nzoie terry And it told me that I was positive. archived recording (natasha singer) And then what did you do? zoie terry So I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do. Because it was very new. So basically, I had to contact the University of Alabama Covid-19 hotline. And, like, there\u2019s a button where it\u2019s like, if you think you may have Covid, press this. If you\u2019re calling for positive test results, press this. So then I pressed that and I was assigned a case manager. And we just \u2014 she talked to me on the phone. I was having a little bit of a meltdown. I was, like, crying and hyperventilating. And she was like, are you OK? Like, I know this is so scary. But you are going to be OK, I promise you. We\u2019re going to get through this. And I will tell you exactly what to do. And I was, like OK, like, thank you so much. And I was, like, trying to calm myself down on the other side of the line. But \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd she gets this email saying to her, you\u2019re going to move to this place. And there\u2019s going to be a lockbox with your key.\n\nzoie terry So I just packed all my clothes and stuff. I packed my TV. And, like, I packed my essential oil diffuser and, like, fun things like that. And try to make it as homey as possible, because I was going to be very homesick, I knew.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she gets the key. And she goes there and she opens the door. And it\u2019s kind of empty.\n\nzoie terry When I went there, there was nobody there. None of the lights were on in the buildings. And I was the only one quarantined in my apartment. I think they were just starting to quarantine people. So everything was very fresh and new to them. And \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThere\u2019s no toilet paper. And there\u2019s no, you know, sanitizer. And there\u2019s nobody to greet her, right? There\u2019s nobody from the university. There\u2019s no nurse. There\u2019s nobody in a mask. There\u2019s no security guard. There\u2019s nobody to escort her in and tell her what\u2019s going to happen and tell her who she can call. She\u2019s basically alone to fend for herself.\n\narchived recording (natasha singer) And so how did that feel, going to this place by yourself? zoie terry Well, I have a lot of anxiety. So it was an experience, me first going there. And keep in mind, I also had corona. So I was very sick and very just \u2014 my emotions were very high. So I just remember I walked in, and I went straight to the furthest room, turned the lights on, shut the door. And I just sat there and started crying. I just cried for, like, five minutes. And then I pulled myself together. And I went and got my stuff from the car.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe calls her mom, who\u2019s a former I.C.U. nurse. And she calls her sister who works in New York. And she basically FaceTimes with them. And that is the beginning of what gets her through it.\n\nzoie terry So basically, my sister took what we called the day shift. First thing I would do when I wake up is call her. So I would have her on FaceTime the entire day. And my mom took the night shifts. So my mom would be on FaceTime with me throughout the night. She likes to say she monitored my breathing just in case something happened in the middle of the night where I passed out or something like that. She wanted to have my attention 24/7, in case I was like unresponsive or something. So \u2014\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBasically you were live streaming 24/7, 12 hours a day with your sister and 12 with your mom?\n\nzoie terry Yeah. I would have panic attacks. And I would think that I was, like, I couldn\u2019t breathe. But it was actually due to my anxiety and panic attacks. So I would, like, tell my mom what I was experiencing and what was happening with my health. And then she would let me know what to do from then on.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo how sick was Zoie?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe had a fever. She was exhausted. She had some breathing issues. Some of it was anxiety. But you know, it\u2019s hard to know. And so that is one of the reasons her mother wanted to monitor her. They also had a recent family tragedy. Zoie\u2019s father had a respiratory illness and he died last year. And so the fact the coronavirus was a respiratory illness, and that Zoie had it, also heightened the anxiety for the whole family and made her mom want to monitor her and act, you know, as the guardian. Because the university is not acting as a guardian of this sick student.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWhat\u2019s happening on campus as Zoie is locked in quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she really was one of the first students to go into this quarantine dorm. But as the days go by, coronavirus is spreading across campus. And so more cars are in the parking lot. A few students begin to move in. Right? And before she\u2019s moved out, there is an outbreak on campus. Kids have been going to parties without their mask on. They\u2019ve been gathering en masse in local bars in Tuscaloosa without masks on. And there is an explosion of virus cases.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Natasha, while Zoie\u2019s been in quarantine, the virus has really been taking off across campus?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nYeah. And the story of how Zoie thinks she got coronavirus is indicative of how the outbreaks are spreading on campus.\n\nzoie terry The one night I had left my sorority house and had went and, like, interacted with friends, it was me and three other girls. And we had all ordered Chipotle to her house. And we all ate dinner together. And we watched a movie.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo she goes to call one of the friends who was at the dinner that night.\n\nzoie terry I was very nervous to call. I said, hey girl, what are you doing? And she was, like, she sounded really upset. And she goes, I\u2019m currently getting tested for Covid. And I was, like, really? That\u2019s so funny you say that. And before I could even finish my sentence, she goes, so and so has it in my house. So if you got it from this person, then I am so sorry. And I said, no, that\u2019s totally fine. I was actually calling you to tell you that I have tested positive for Covid, and that you need to get tested. And she goes, no, yeah, I\u2019m getting tested right now. So thank you for telling me.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo it turned out that all the girls who were at the dinner that evening ended up getting coronavirus. And this was before classes had even started. So you can imagine how the virus started to spread as students were returning to campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo this extensive plan that the state had for testing, what went wrong?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nThey tested tens of thousands of students before they came back to campus. But there was a really weak link in this testing protocol. And that was students had to be tested within two weeks of coming back to campus. But that means, like, you could test me two weeks before I go back to campus, and then I could go to a party and get Covid.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOr I might not know I have it, right, and you test me, and it takes four days to develop. And then I\u2019m going to bring my Covid with me to campus. And so there was a huge effort to do this testing. But I interviewed an epidemiologist who said it was kind of useless to test kids even a week out. And Alabama did its best. And I asked them why they used this two-week window. And they said, look, we are testing kids at scale. It was believed to be the largest student testing program in terms of higher ed anywhere in the country. And there was no way they could have processed all those 150,000 tests only two days before classes start. So they traded off getting everybody for, you know, in fact not doing it so close to the return.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nSo what is the situation on campus when Zoie gets out of quarantine?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nSo after 10 days, Zoie is finally free.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) Guess what, you guys? I am done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe makes this jailbreak TikTok.\n\ntiktok clip (zoie terry) And you might be asking yourself, Zoie, what is the first thing you do when you\u2019re free? And to that I say, I get Dunkin\u2019 with Linda!\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd then she goes home to visit her mom and her dog.\n\nzoie terry And my dog \u2014 [LAUGHS] \u2014 he didn\u2019t really recognize it was me, though. It was kind of sad. Because I had the mask on \u2014 until I started speaking in my dog voice. Everybody has one. archived recording (natasha singer) Can you use your dog voice? zoie terry Oh, no. (IN DOG VOICE) I just talk like this to my Simon. He\u2019s very cute. I just talk like this to him. archived recording (natasha singer) It sounds like your own language. zoie terry He knows, he knows \u2014 if I were to say, \u201cSimon, come here\u201d in my normal voice, he wouldn\u2019t know that I was talking to him. But if I was, like, (IN DOG VOICE) \u201cSimon, come here,\u201d then he would know I was talking to him. archived recording (natasha singer) I love that.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nBy the time, Zoie gets back to campus, it\u2019s a completely different place. There are even more restrictions in place to try to get a handle on this virus outbreak on campus. Students are essentially confined to their room except for essential activities. They can\u2019t have any gatherings. They can\u2019t hang out in their dorms. They can\u2019t go to common spaces. The dining hall is closed except for takeout. And the bars in Tuscaloosa are closed for two weeks.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s very strange. Honestly, it\u2019s not very fun. I could be doing a way cheaper option of doing, like, a community college online instead of paying my tuition that I\u2019m paying right now.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd so she basically spends a lot of time in her room. The majority of her classes are now online except for one of them. And yet, she still wants to be there.\n\nzoie terry But also, I\u2019m here for like the education and the resources they have for the major I\u2019m in.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd it really matters to her.\n\nzoie terry My mom and my dad both went here. And so that\u2019s why I mainly chose to come to school here, is because I am the last child out of 5 to go to college. And the only one to go to \u2018Bama. So it was kind of a given for me to come here. natasha singer So you\u2019re like the Roll Tide legacy? zoie terry Definitely. We are a big, big, big football fan family.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nShe\u2019s carrying on this major family tradition that is both educational and intellectual and social. And she wants to stick it out. And they all hope the university can pull this off.\n\nzoie terry It\u2019s just kind of upsetting. Because my freshman year wasn\u2019t that great. Because I was just getting over the passing of my dad, and I was dealing with grief my entire freshman year. So I was kind of looking forward to my sophomore year thinking, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s going to be so much fun. Like, I\u2019m going to meet all these new people. And now that I\u2019m here and everything\u2019s happening with Covid, we can\u2019t have the sophomore year that everybody else has been able to have in years past. And I can\u2019t even imagine how the freshmen feel. I feel so bad for them. Because they\u2019re coming to college and, like, this isn\u2019t what college is like. Like, during rush, I was telling people, I was like, I promise this isn\u2019t what college is like. It\u2019s so much more fun this. And it\u2019s going to be OK. We\u2019re going to get through this. We just have to get over this hump. And once everything\u2019s better, hopefully we get a vaccine, and maybe one day things can go back to normal. But until then, we just gotta push through this time and hope for things to get better.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd what is your understanding of why states and schools like the University of Alabama pushed to do this in the first place?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nI think that there are multiple factors that affect whether universities decided to reopen or not. And there are fascinating calculations that went on about what number or percent of students are going to get the virus, and what is an acceptable risk to take. And we see that some universities, even large state universities, made the decision that they were not going to reopen for in-person instruction. They were not going to bring students back to campus. Some of them made that decision for the semester and some said, look, we\u2019re going to spend the first six weeks online and we\u2019ll see what happens. And other universities made the calculation that it would be much better to reopen. It would be better for their financial interests and financial survival. It would be better for students who would have a much better experience. There\u2019s nothing that beats in-person interaction. They were going to, you know, cause education loss and emotional kind of growth loss by not opening.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nCan you explain the financial piece of that a little bit more, the financial calculation?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nRight. Well, universities obviously need tuition money and residential hall kind of dorm occupancy money and dining hall money to keep going. And yes, state schools get state money. But they also need revenue. And so there\u2019s a large financial calculation about, you know, are we going to not reopen and lose all that income? Or are we going to open and get some of that income? And are we going to open and get some of that income, knowing we\u2019re going to close, but at least we\u2019ll have reaped some of that? So there\u2019s a big picture financial driver behind deciding to reopen or not. And then there are financial decisions every step of the way. Like, OK, we\u2019re going to reopen. Are we going to reopen at full dorm occupancy and get all that money that we need for residential life? Or are we going to take a hit and actually say only freshmen and seniors can come back? And that will allow us to have only one student per room. And that will really reduce the risk, we hope, of spread of virus. But we\u2019re going to take a financial hit. And so we see universities making different calculations. Some have decided we\u2019re not going to test kids. We\u2019re only going to test kids for the virus if they show symptoms or if they\u2019ve been exposed. We see other universities, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and they have decided they\u2019re going to test every student twice a week. This is a major state university deciding the only way they can reopen safely is to test every student two times a week, week after week. Right? That is a financial calculation. They\u2019re going to spend that money because they\u2019re trying to buy down risk. And then there\u2019s the political calculation. If you are a Republican governor in a largely Republican state, where there is a debate over whether people should be required to wear masks or not, there might be other reasons why you decide that you should reopen. Because your constituents want you to reopen and your president wants you to reopen.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nRight.\n\nnatasha singer\n\nAnd we saw Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, say recently that it is much more risky now for universities that have reopened and have large outbreaks to send students home, where they might spread the virus, than to keep them there. And so we\u2019re seeing universities that in a sense fostered virus outbreaks by reopening have to keep the virus outbreaks under control by keeping students on campus.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nAnd Natasha, your reporting on what happened to Zoie and the University of Alabama first published a few days ago. What has happened since then?\n\nnatasha singer\n\nOn the same day the story came out, about eight hours later, the president of the University of Alabama sent out this message to students and faculty and staff and parents. And what he said was that they were implementing these important new changes.\n\nnatasha singer Do you know that the university sent out an email after the story came out that they\u2019re going to change quarantine and isolation? zoie terry I did not know that. natasha singer Well, I\u2019m just going to read it to you. Because I got an email from the president of U Alabama today. zoie terry OK. natasha singer I\u2019m going to read it to you. OK. So: \u201cDear students, faculty, staff and parents, hoping your Labor Day weekend was safe and relaxing. I want to update you on Covid-19 steps we have implemented effective today. \u201cFor our students who test positive and prepare to move to campus isolation spaces, staffing and medical resources have been enhanced to ensure prompt communication and expanded services.\u201d zoie terry That\u2019s amazing. Wow, OK. That makes me so happy. natasha singer Congratulations, Zoie. You\u2019ve made the University of Alabama quarantine better. zoie terry Thank you. Oh, my gosh. That\u2019s so great. Oh, that makes me feel so much better. For people I know going into quarantine, and if I have to go into quarantine again, like later on this year? Oh, that makes me feel so much better. Thank you so much. I\u2019m super happy that I had a voice in all of this. Because at the beginning when I first went into quarantine, I just sat in that room and cried because I was like, nobody\u2019s going to hear my story about this at all. Nobody is going to know about this. And now that I actually have a voice and people are going to hear about this, I\u2019m super thankful.\n\n[music]\n\nmegan twohey\n\nIn the latest reports from the University of Alabama, more than 2,500 students and nearly 1,200 faculty and staff have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past month. But in recent days, the school reports that the virus is slowing. And on Monday, they announced they were easing some of the rules around the lockdown on campus. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. On the Gulf Coast, states are bracing for Hurricane Sally to make landfall near Alabama. The storm is expected to hit today.\n\narchived recording (kay ivey) Those who live on the Gulf Coast are all too familiar with Mother Nature\u2019s wrath. We still hope and pray that Sally will not bring that type of pain and heartache. But my fellow Alabamians, Hurricane Sally is not to be taken for granted.\n\nmegan twohey\n\nWith warnings of devastating floods and threats of tornadoes, Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama is urging residents along the coast to evacuate low lying areas. Officials expect as much as 30 inches of rainfall in some places and storm surges as high as six to nine feet.

(Its population is 42.5 percent Latino.) He is Long Beach\u2019s first openly gay mayor. (Mr. Garcia married his husband in 2018, which also made him the city\u2019s first mayor to tie the knot while in office.)\n\nMore recently, Mr. Garcia has made headlines for speaking up about something that has nothing to do with his political career. On July 26, his mother, 61, died of Covid-19 complications. His stepfather, 58, died of the virus two weeks later.\n\nAs my colleagues reported, the 17-speaker \u201ckeynote\u201d felt different than it has in past conventions.

Here\u2019s our conversation, lightly edited and condensed:\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to talk with me. First, I wanted to say I\u2019m so sorry about your parents. They sounded like they were really amazing people. Can I ask you to talk a bit about them? How do you think they would have responded to your appearance at the convention?", "The three women at the center of \u201cSisters in Hate\u201d were born in 1979, but that\u2019s about all they have in common. Corinna Olsen, from Oregon, has worked as a porn star, a bodybuilder and a professional embalmer. Ayla Stewart grew up in Las Vegas, and before becoming known online as \u201cWife with a Purpose,\u201d a Christian stay-at-home mother of six whose broadcasts spew hatred toward anyone whose life choices are different, she flirted with a feminist version of New Age culture that included pagan goddess worship and veganism. Lana Lokteff, once a self-described \u201cgrunge puppy\u201d from the Pacific Northwest, now lives in Charleston, S.C., where she and her Swedish husband run Red Ice, a popular website and radio show that promotes apocalyptic racist propaganda. In emphasizing the specificity of their stories, Darby also underscores that all three women made choices. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to acknowledge the rampant, persistent sexism of the far right while also giving women the credit they deserve. \u2026 We risk stripping them of responsibility when we suggest that the harm they do is merely a way of coping with their own oppression.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nAs we learn more about them, we learn how their choices evolved. Corinna left the movement and even became an F.B.I. informer after realizing that a group she belonged to was planning to commit mass murder. Ayla and Lana cooperated briefly with Darby\u2019s reporting before deciding she was a leftist, feminist journalist who couldn\u2019t be trusted to adequately portray their continuing commitment to the white supremacist cause. In showing that white nationalism is not monolithic, Darby stresses its supporters\u2019 agency \u2014 reminding us that those supporters could always choose to act differently, and sometimes do.\n\nWhat makes such different women vulnerable to the movement\u2019s hateful propaganda? Darby draws on familiar studies in behavioral science that show the importance of repetition: The more you hear something repeated with conviction, the harder it is to believe it isn\u2019t true. Smartly, Darby also suggests that \u201clife in contemporary America may be enough to incline a person toward conspiracism.\u201d This was true before the current administration. Few Americans know that other wealthy nations \u2014 not just Scandinavia! \u2014 take for granted what Americans are lacking: universal health care, paid sick leave, parental leave, guaranteed vacations and other benefits regarded in this country as privileges to be granted, or denied, at employers\u2019 whims. Even though few Americans know these benefits are elsewhere called rights, their absence creates anxiety, social instability and a floating resentment that can easily turn violent, especially in places where any 18-year-old can buy an assault weapon but not a bottle of beer.\n\nBut Darby doesn\u2019t succumb to the idea that white nationalism is the product of economic insecurity; the statistics are too clear. She quotes the political scientist Ashley Jardina, who found that most white nationalists \u201cown houses, have average incomes similar to most whites in the United States, are employed and identify as middle class.\u201d (We\u2019d prefer to believe that Nazism too was supported by poor and illiterate masses, but a high percentage of Nazi Party members in Germany had college degrees.)\n\nWhile all three of Darby\u2019s subjects were influenced by the lies they ingested on right-wing radio and websites, all three denied they hated the Black people, Jews or Latinos regularly vilified on such sites. Darby writes, \u201cWhite nationalists are posing a challenge: If other groups can rally around their history, why not white people?\u201d This is not a stupid question. Darby answers it by saying it promotes a false equivalence, \u201cshorn of context, nuance and power disparities. In theory, though, it\u2019s more effective from a P.R. standpoint than lynchings, cross burnings and slur-filled pamphlets.\u201d", "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Contracts are being doled out to family members.

And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American, and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can\u2019t win you over with their policies. So they\u2019re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.\u201d \u201cWith only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I hereby declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic candidate for vice president.\u201d \u201cShe is the first black woman, first South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.\u201d \u201cThis is a historic pick.\u201d \u201cSomeone who looks like us on a presidential ticket, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u201cThat I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all. This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting long after its ratification. But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight, but I know she\u2019s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. On that day she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. Make no mistake: The road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths, and we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it was examining the use of C.T. measures \u201cfor policy decisions,\u201d and that it would need to collaborate with the Food and Drug Administration and device manufacturers to ensure the measures \u201ccan be used properly and with assurance that we know what they mean.\u201d\n\nIn three sets of testing data that did include C.T. values, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of positive samples barely carried any virus, a review by The Times found. If that rate applied nationwide, then only about 4,500 of the 45,604 new U.S. cases reported on Thursday would actually require isolation and contact tracing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of mind-blowing to me that people are not recording the C.T. values from all these tests \u2014 that they\u2019re just returning a positive or a negative,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York.", "The largely virtual format of the Republican and Democratic national conventions meant that even more than usual, the messages were embedded within the visual presentation. Here Vanessa Friedman, the chief fashion critic for The New York Times, and James Poniewozik, the chief television critic, discuss what they saw and what it all meant.\n\nVANESSA FRIEDMAN Hi James! So the first mostly virtual party conventions are a wrap. I know the situation was foisted on us all by the pandemic, but it did make for some interesting viewing, and a reframing of the actual events in a way that was \u2014 maybe? \u2014 more honest about what they actually are.\n\nI\u2019ve got to say: The contrast could not have been more graphic by the end. On the one hand, you had the D.N.C., which took place almost entirely remotely, with Zoom panels with \u201creal\u201d (impossible word) voters, and speeches recorded in people\u2019s homes (Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton), schools (Jill Biden), and empty auditoriums (Kamala Harris, Joe Biden). You had some of that with the R.N.C. But Trump\u2019s final speech \u2014 live! With audience! At the White House! \u2014 completely changed the equation.\n\nFor me, the first was smaller in scale, more human, and reflected the emptiness and weirdness of the current pandemic age. The second was all about triumphalism, pomp and circumstance. But both were also highly-produced shows, complete with set, soundtrack, costumes and script. My question for you is: Were they the ultimate reality-TV show \u2014 sort of a cross between \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Politics\u201d and \u201cSurvivor,\u201d with some \u201cBachelor\u201d thrown in? Or more like \u201cMasterpiece Theater\u201d?"], "20200829": [], "20200830": [], "20200831": []}
