Especially in middle school or elementary school kids are very vulnerable and believe everything they see or hear especially if it\u2019s said by someone they\u2019re supposed to trust. Teachers should be able to teach what each side supports and what they stand for, as long they are not biased towards a side.\n\n\u2014 Ethan, Glenbard West High School\n\nWhile some kids might agree with their politics, others who don\u2019t could get offended and this would hurt their learning environment. Furthermore, even if they do not get offended, it is not the teacher\u2019s job to directly influence a student\u2019s political views. They can only give facts and information. If this was allowed then there would be many arguments against students and teachers since many people are very passionate about their political beliefs and this of course would waste class time and create drama. This is the complete opposite of an effective working environment which is not what we need.\n\n\u2014 Ivan Doll Block 1, Hoggard Highschool, wilmington NC\n\nAlthough freedom of speech is extremely important, it\u2019s evident it gets muted when we attend school, at least for students and teachers should be treated with the same regard. Many teachers bring their opinion into their classrooms and that\u2019s not new or avoidable but it\u2019s wrong \u2026 When opinion is being brought in it stirs the pot and doesn\u2019t allow for much mental freedom. When looking at the bigger picture, is it worth distracting students or staff from the scheduled day at school for a problematic debate on something they will never agree on? This is a distraction and I\u2019ve yet to see why it is so important to walk around with political speech on your clothing. After all, hate, and inappropriate speech is banned from most school due to it being problematic and a distraction so why wouldn\u2019t political speech be in the same category if it has a similar result?\n\n\u2014 Maddie F, Farmington High School\n\nI think that we all have the right to express our own beliefs no matter what you believe in so long as it isn\u2019t hateful. But I also believe in the statement \u201cIf even one kid said \u2018I am afraid of that symbol,\u2019 isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d that we saw in the article \u2026 I just feel that these things are topics that would make us the students uncomfortable if we were to hear a teacher talking about.\n\n\u2014 Adam M, IPoly High\n\nSome Symbols Should Be Allowed; Others Should Not.\n\nEducationally speaking, professors should never push their beliefs onto students since their role is to guide and not influence; nonetheless, that doesn\u2019t mean they must never reveal their political views. My opinion is stained by my hypocrisy, as I would find it acceptable for a teacher to wear a BLM shirt but not an ALM one since, from my perspective, it only serves to spread hate. However, what I stated was my opinion, and different people find different things harmful.\n\n\u2014 Maria Bivar, American School of Recife, Brazil\n\nSchools should promote unity, friendship, and love towards all. Teachers are shaping the future of America and that should reflect the goals of the United States Constitution, a plan of unity. That being said, any propaganda that promotes love and equality: such as a black lives matter shirt, or an LGBTQAI+ flag should be allowed. Anything with any and all connotation towards hatred or supremacy over another group needs to be forbidden.\n\n\u2014 Tatum Anderson, Maury High School\n\nHuman rights are not political, no matter how many people think they are. For example, women\u2019s rights, gay rights, black rights, and the rights of any other person of a minority (since majority rights are never infringed or have been fought for). My math teacher, Mr. Slotnick has a gay pride flag and a BLM poster in his room. He is not advocating for a specific political party or idea, although one party may have more united approval for one party over the other). Agreeing or disagreeing with minority rights does not mean you disagree politically, it just means you discriminate against minorities. However, some ideas (flags, messages, etc.) have become a topic for political speech. The American flag with the blue line in the middle used to not be political, but it is now used as a counter-protest to Black Lives Matter. Both support groups individually are not political, but when pitched against each other do create political tension and controversy.\n\n\u2014 Marco Pacheco, Miami Country Day School, FL"], "20201204": [], "20201205": [], "20201206": [], "20201207": [], "20201208": [], "20201209": ["This new joke managed to be entirely different from the original without changing the words. What began as a deadpan quip became something much broader, more physical, exposing a sillier side of Lynch. Onstage, she can seem aloof. But here, in this intimate video, she was ingratiatingly goofy. Lynch said partly this was because she was performing home alone and felt relaxed, but paradoxically, she sees this version of her as more of a performance. \u201cTikTok feels more like a character,\u201d she said. \u201cMore of a persona, like I\u2019m just acting.\u201d\n\nWhatever she was doing, it worked. The video took off, rocketing to a million views, and in the past month, as she posted clips daily, her followers tripled. She even started receiving small payments from TikTok, earning $100 in the past month. \u201cThere are more old people on TikTok than I realized,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because of Covid and people are bored, but they\u2019re out there.\u201d\n\nAfter posting the video on other platforms, she found that the joke didn\u2019t have the same impact on each one. She was far less successful on Instagram and barely made a ripple on Twitter. TikTok is more likely to show videos from people who aren\u2019t following you, which can expose you to new fans. In an effort to compete, Instagram started a TikTok-like service, Reels, in August. That\u2019s where Lynch had the most success with the boyfriend joke, racking up 2.5 million views. After struggling to raise her Instagram follower count, she\u2019s seen major growth since that joke went viral. \u201cI was at 12,400 forever and even when I did Fallon, I might have gotten 500, but in the last two weeks, I had 5,000 new followers and that\u2019s from Reels.\u201d\n\nThese are still small numbers compared with popular influencers, and most comics like Carmen Lynch are not going to make a living off social media. They are aiming to build their audience and hoping that translates to ticket sales when live shows return.\n\nComics tend to be alert to the audience, but many veterans have chosen not to spend much time telling jokes on social media. Some aren\u2019t digital natives, some understandably think stand-up is an inextricably live form and others see social media as beneath them.\n\nBut like it or not, these platforms are where much of the comedy audience is now. The pandemic has accelerated the transition to digital, and there will be an impact on the business and aesthetic of comedy. It matters that a club crowd\u2019s laugh is less quantifiable than the raw numbers on social media.", "Drug use is a complicated issue. Personally, I have no problem with marijuana legalization. Since Americans have the right to drink alcohol once they are of age, I do not see why marijuana should be any different since the two substances are very similar.

On one hand, the decriminalization of non-addictive drugs with comparatively lower consequences \u2014 like marijuana \u2014 is an effective way to reduce high incarceration rates. On the other hand, decriminalizing drugs like heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine overlooks the underlying cause of drug-related incarcerations: addiction. With a dependence on the drug, individuals will continue to utilize it upon release, thus continuing the cycle. Therefore, solutions like the CREATE Opportunities Act \u2014 a federal grant to promote rehabilitation in correctional facilities \u2014 proposes a more effective option to combat drug-related incarnations and the opioid crisis.\n\n\u2014 Julia Oledzka, Glenbard West High School\n\nUnjust Justice?\n\nI think that marijuana should be legalized, as we have not seen many negative cases regarding marijuana.

This can lead to a downward spiral in life as a former prisoner would have to turn to other means of making money like stealing or selling drugs because they would not get hired as a result of their priors. Drug users should instead be rehabilitated so that they can have a better quality of life versus a worse one.\n\n\u2014 Jorge Rivera, Middletown, NJ\n\nDue to the sheer number of people surviving time for possession I think we should decriminalize all drugs. I especially feel that this should be applied to marijuana because it is not only decriminalized but approved for recreational use in some states. In the United States we have very overcrowded jails. In addition to that lots of the people serving time for drug possession are serving absurdly long times because of racial disparity. This is a huge problem and It needs to be addressed. Part of the way I think we could improve this situation is by doing what the article suggests and offer treatment for addiction. Being able to overcome the flaws in the system would be extremely beneficial for the government, economy and many communities.\n\n\u2014 Abby C., Cary High School\n\nRehabilitation Over Punishment\n\nI think that we focus too much on punishment with drugs rather than rehabilitation. A lot of people who use drugs are not necessarily bad people and ultimately just need help. In places like Denmark drug clinics are in place to offer cleaner drugs and move towards rehabilitation. In the US however, it seems like we are way too harsh on users, there\u2019s a good chance that the drug is used as a way to cope, unhealthy as it is. Instead of demonizing and criminalizing users, we should try to be more understanding and focus on rehabilitating them. I don\u2019t think this means legalizing hard drugs like heroin and cocaine, but the consequences should not be so harsh. As for marijuana, the way I see it is if we can legalize tobacco, we can legalize marijuana. Cigarettes can and will damage your lungs if not used in limitation, the same goes for marijuana. If used in limitation marijuana is fine, if used in excess it can have negative effects on your brain and health. It seems to me the war on drugs has had the opposite effect of what was intended. Because drugs have been so criminalized, demand for them goes higher, therefore more criminals and dealers. Plus because of the harsh prison sentences on users, they have a harder time finding jobs after prison which leads them to crime as a result.\n\n\u2014 Sahil F., Cary High School\n\nIt is difficult to determine whether drugs should be legal recreationally. However, I believe all drugs should remain illegal, but better institutions should be funded to prevent relapse. Personally, the logic behind legalizing drugs doesn\u2019t make sense. If legislation were to legalize the consumption of marijuana nationally, we start ourselves down a difficult path. This is because the main characteristic of any serotonin releasing activity is that the subject wants to feel that feeling again. Ultimately, this means that once marijuana becomes legal, it will be almost impossible to retreat without serious backlash. Drugs cause feelings in people that can make them unreasonable. This worries me. Additionally, we don\u2019t know the side effects of legalizing cannabis nationally. How will it impede youth user rates, DUIs, work production, and even attics to stronger drugs? However, the system in place now clearly is insufficient. Instead of decriminalizing the offense, we should focus on the rehabilitation centers as a form aid instead of imprisonment. This would prevent the possible side effects of national legalization while still keeping people out of jail.\n\n\u2014 Charlie Lange, Glenbard West\n\nDecriminalization Is Not the Answer.\n\nI do not think we should decriminalize the possession of drugs. Medical use should be legal, but not recreational use. Whether it\u2019s legal or illegal, people are going to do drugs. The difference is that if it is illegal, we have more of an opportunity to make change. We can put people in rehab. We can regulate it better. Quite frankly, the last thing we need in the country is easier access to drugs. That\u2019s the biggest danger of decriminalization \u2014 increased access. Too many people are dead from drugs, or have their lives ruined by them; which is why the rehab would be good. The only reason prison rates are rising is because we have created this vicious cycle. People do drugs, don\u2019t get help, and are therefore in and out of jail (repeat offenders). Then their kids follow suit and it creates a cycle. That cycle can be stopped.

U.S.A. Latina, Black and Asian-American women have been hit hardest, the report found. Many entered the pandemic earning less, and they have experienced higher jobless rates in the downturn, said a co-author of the report, Victoria M. DeFrancesco Soto, assistant dean at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas.\n\n\u201cThey already were vulnerable, and many may never become fully employed again,\u201d she said.\n\nLosses can be steep over time.\n\nEven a short-term interruption in wages can have a surprisingly large impact on retirement. Each year out of the work force translates into losses considerably larger than the immediate salary over the arc of a career, according to research by the Center for American Progress. The losses compound over time in the form of missed wage growth, retirement savings and Social Security benefits, as illustrated by a calculator developed by the center.\n\nFor example, a 35-year-old woman earning $80,000 a year who leaves the work force for five years can expect to lose $197,000 in retirement assets and benefits, assuming she retires at age 67, according to the calculator.\n\n\u201cMy biggest worry about what\u2019s going to happen as a result of this recession in the longer term is that we\u2019ll be setting back families dramatically,\u201d said Michael Madowitz, an economist with the center who developed the calculator.\n\nJobless rates for women have spiked.
