A slide outlined the terms: a month of severance pay, three months of medical benefits and one year to exercise their stock options.\n\nThe workers were asked to mail in their laptops, said Jenny Alvauaje, a Bird data analyst who was on the call.

Public preschool effectively ameliorates this situation: a structured school routine with attentive teachers provides a safe haven for these children and levels the playing field with their more fortunate peers.

The first years of a child\u2019s life is when they get to know their parents and their surroundings and what they call home, and the same goes for the parents getting to know their child. I have seen this happen in many families, both parents go to work while the child stays in child care/preschool. They come back home tired, and might even have further work to do at home, and so they will be even busier and won\u2019t even be able to ask about their child\u2019s day. Education is important, but so is feeling enough love and care from parents in those first few years of a child\u2019s life. And Children will get a lot of education later on. But what can they possibly learn, academically, at the age of 3 that is so crucial to the point that it\u2019s worth losing the first precious years of a child\u2019s life with their parents?\n\n\u2014 Marina Kest, CA", "This step is also an opportunity to understand what\u2019s at the heart of your personal stress or anxiety. Are you most worried about getting sick, or are you worried about a vulnerable loved one? Are you most stressed about balancing working from home with family responsibilities, or about losing your job?\n\nOnce you determine what\u2019s stressing you specifically, you can also examine your reactions to these stressors. What emotions are you experiencing: frustration, sadness, anger? And what do you notice in your body: Do you feel tightness in your neck and shoulders, or do you have difficulty sleeping?\n\nStep 2: Own Your Stress\n\nThe next step is to welcome, or \u201cown,\u201d your stress. Why would we want to welcome stress into our lives, especially during a pandemic? We only stress about things that we care about. By owning our stress, we connect to the positive motivation or personal value behind our stress. If we deny or avoid our stress, we may actually be denying or disconnecting ourselves from the things we value and treasure most.\n\nIn order to connect with the values and goals underlying your stress, try completing this sentence about whatever was specifically stressing you out in step one: \u201cI\u2019m stressed about [insert stressor from step one] because I deeply care about \u2026\u201d\n\nStep 3: Use Your Stress\n\nConnecting to the core values behind your stress sets you up for the third and most essential step: using or leveraging stress to achieve your goals and connect more deeply with the things that matter most.\n\nAsk yourself: Are your typical responses in alignment with the values behind your stress? If you\u2019re worried about your family getting sick because you care about their health, is snapping at them for not washing their hands for long enough the best way to protect your family? If you\u2019re worried about the impact of coronavirus on society, is seeking out constant news coverage the best way to help support your community during this time? Think about how you might change your response to this stress to better facilitate your goals and your purpose.\n\nThere\u2019s so much happening right now that we can\u2019t control. But \u2014 as many people are noticing \u2014 there are also unprecedented opportunities amid the fear. Some psychologists argue that true transformative change can occur only during stress or crises.

The good news is that the rest of us have a strong intuitive grasp of what it means. The problem is that the people who are supposed to help us decide what to do about it \u2014 economists, policymakers and political leaders \u2014 do not.\n\nOne common mistake, according to this book by two economists, is thinking about uncertainty as if it were roulette. When you play the casino game, you do not know where the ball will land, but you do know all the places it can land. If you\u2019re clever, you may even know how likely it is that the ball will land in a given place. In real life, however, uncertainty and its many cousins \u2014 obscurity, ignorance, vagueness and ambiguity \u2014 mean that not only do we often not know how likely an event is, we simply have no idea about all the kinds of events that can happen.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis is, of course, an excellent example of the ways that the past may be a disastrous guide to either the present or the future. Most of the data leading into the crisis wasn\u2019t much help in predicting it, and the lived experience of most so-called experts didn\u2019t help either. Kay and King skewer pre-crisis pomposity and they tell diverse and fascinating stories about corporate culture, the inequitable remuneration of chief executives, the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the manufacturers of the Airbus, NASA and the traffic app Waze. Their book is demanding, and at times difficult, but it is also an elegant and careful guide to thinking about personal and social economics, especially in a time of uncertainty.

Anxiety about health, education and finances is high. Children aren\u2019t seeing the teachers, counselors and other adults who would normally raise concerns about their well-being. The Covid-19 pandemic has created the conditions for a rise in child abuse that could go unchecked.\n\nAlready there are reports of a surge in suspected child abuse cases in Texas. We\u2019ve seen this before during stressful times. During the 2008 recession, pediatricians reported a rise in infant injuries and deaths from abusive head trauma, a trend that lingered for years after the economy recovered.\n\nWhen there is household dysfunction \u2014 domestic violence, parental substance abuse or a mental disorder \u2014 the risk of child abuse goes up, and there\u2019s reason to believe all of these things will increase during this pandemic. New York is seeing an uptick in domestic violence. Suicide hotline calls are up around the country. For as long as we\u2019re confined to our homes, many parents who are struggling with these issues will no longer have any reprieve from the hard work of keeping children fed, entertained and educated.\n\nChildren could be at risk for sexual violence in particular. An estimated one in four girls are sexually abused by age 18, and the abuse is typically perpetrated by a family member in the child\u2019s home. Too often, children disclose the abuse to their mothers but the perpetrator remains in the home because he is the primary breadwinner. I worry that our current reality \u2014 the lack of opportunities to seek refuge outside the home combined with the difficulty of finding new living arrangements when money is tight \u2014 makes it even less likely that young victims will be able to escape their abusers.", "I spend a lot of time thinking about what it means to be alone.\n\nI\u2019m a writer in my mid-40s who is neither partnered nor has children, so alone is my modus operandi.

Generations of federal policymakers have prioritized the pursuit of economic growth with scant regard for stability or distribution. This moment demands a restoration of the national commitment to a richer conception of freedom: economic security and equality of opportunity. That\u2019s why Times Opinion is publishing this project across the next two months, to envision how to turn the America we have into the America we need.\n\nThe purpose of the federal government, Lincoln wrote to Congress on July 4, 1861, was \u201cto elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial burdens from all shoulders, and to give everyone an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life.\u201d The Homestead Act in particular was a concrete step in that direction: 10 percent of all the land in the United States was ultimately distributed in 160-acre chunks. But Lincoln\u2019s conception of \u201ceveryone\u201d did not include everyone: The Homestead Act rested on the expropriation of Native American lands.\n\nRoosevelt shared Lincoln\u2019s vision of government, but industry had replaced agriculture as the wellspring of prosperity, so he focused on ensuring a more equitable distribution of the nation\u2019s manufacturing output \u2014 although African-Americans were treated as second-class citizens in many New Deal programs.\n\nThe United States today is in need of new measures to stake all Americans in the modern economy.\n\nTo give Americans a fair chance in the race of life, the government must begin from birth. The United States must reclaim the core truth of the Supreme Court\u2019s seminal decision in Brown v. Board of Education: So long as Americans are segregated, their opportunities can never be equal. One of the most important steps the United States can take to ensure all children have the opportunity to thrive is to bulldoze enduring patterns of racial and economic segregation. Zoning laws that limit residential development in the very areas where good jobs are most abundant are one of the most important structural obstacles to a more integrated nation.\n\nOver the course of this project, we will examine other ways to equalize opportunity early in life, and also to restore a healthier balance of power between employers and workers.\n\nOne of the clearest lessons of the pandemic is that many employers feel shockingly little obligation to protect the health and welfare of their workers, and workers have been left with little means to organize or resist. Amazon, one of the nation\u2019s largest employers, fired a worker protesting safety conditions at the company\u2019s warehouses on the Orwellian grounds that his protest was itself a safety hazard. A manager at a Uline call center instructed employees not to tell colleagues if they weren\u2019t feeling well because it might cause \u201cunnecessary panic.\u201d\n\nAnd the nation\u2019s tattered social safety net is in desperate need of reinforcement. Americans need reliable access to health care. Americans need affordable options for child care and for the care of older members of their families, a growing crisis in an aging nation. No one, and especially not children, should ever go hungry.

Isn\u2019t the hospital full? He suggests that I take a walk down the hall and make a right, less than 100 yards away.\n\nI swipe open the unit, which usually serves as a post\u00adoperative area, with my ID. I see a room about half the size of the E.R. It\u2019s a Sunday, a slow day usually, but still, there\u2019s only one patient, who\u2019s being tended to by a nursing assistant. A nurse hovers nearby. I track the green oxygen dispensers on the walls, these fountains of life that my patients gravely need. I go upstairs to one of the regular floors. It\u2019s calm and quiet. Unlike in the E.R., where I dodge patients, colleagues and stretchers to get around \u2014 forget six feet of separation; we\u2019re not able to maintain six inches \u2014 here the hallways are free and unobstructed. It\u2019s just a regular hospital floor, but the space feels glorious, luxurious.\n\nIt\u2019s the first day of our pulse-ox to-go program. Until this point, I have been opposed to the idea of sending hypoxic patients home with pulse oximeters, especially after learning from the Italian doctors that their oxygen numbers often drop quickly to life-threatening levels \u2014 sometimes before the patients feel it. These guidelines seem too unsafe to me. A colleague begs me to rethink this, telling me they will get better care at home with their family members than here in the E.R., at least in its current state. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying this as someone who doesn\u2019t believe in these guidelines,\u201d he adds.

Still, I wish we could regularly get swabbed and checked when we know we have been exposed, even those of us without symptoms, so that we don\u2019t inadvertently pass it on to our patients. Some of us are also eager for antibody testing, seeking a sense of security if we end up having antibodies, though it\u2019s probably too early to say whether or for how long that could actually provide immunity.\n\nIn the E.R., I run into two co-workers who have recovered from the virus and are back at work. Our E.R. colleague across town is out of the I.C.U. I look at a photo of her eating and smiling on Facebook. The next day, I see on Twitter that James Pruden, a 70-year-old doctor in New Jersey, is leaving the hospital after spending nearly a month in the I.C.U. He was one of the first doctors hospitalized for coronavirus infection in the United States. I didn\u2019t think he would make it, because of his age and how sick he seemed. In a video clip, Pruden, in a blue dress shirt, is wheeled out on a stretcher and points energetically at the surrounding crowd. I\u2019ve never met him, but I\u2019m immediately tearful. I replay the recording four more times. Then I send the tweet to a colleague who works with him. \u201cSomething going our way for a change,\u201d he responds. \u201cIf he can do this, we sure can.\u201d\n\nLater that same day, though, I get a text that several more of our E.R. staff members are hospitalized, requiring oxygen. I learn that another died a few days earlier. More co-workers are ill at home with symptoms. At night, I open an email that a doctor in Brooklyn forwarded to me with the names of more health care workers in New York City who have died. I hadn\u2019t even heard of their deaths.\n\nOver the next several days, I notice the tone changing during my shifts. Conversations about dying and death are all around me now, the only kind I hear. Either I am having one or the physician next to me is.

California is inching forward with plans to gradually ease restrictions it imposed to curb the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut to do that safely, some rules will be necessary: Masks and face coverings are likely to remain a feature of public life; patrons of restaurants will probably have their temperatures taken before being seated and will be served by someone in a mask and gloves; in the fall, students may attend school in shifts to avoid crowded classrooms.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom did not give a time frame, saying he would revisit the question in two weeks, but assured residents: \u201cNormal it will not be.\u201d", "Bret: There is no way that the federal government can keep pace with the scale of need, even if someone a whole lot more competent than Donald Trump were in charge. We have a $4 trillion federal government trying to hold up a $20 trillion economy: That\u2019s unsustainable. If you taxed the 400 richest Americans down to their last cent \u2014 about $3 trillion or so \u2014 that would only get us through a few months of payments to unemployed workers or cash-strapped businesses. The government can always print money, but at some point that would start showing up in all kinds of toxic ways, likely including inflation.\n\nGail: I\u2019m not envisioning a shutdown of the total economy for months and months. But we\u2019re not nearly ready to go back to normal now. And seeing the president wringing his hands on TV every day doesn\u2019t help.\n\nBret: I agree that there won\u2019t be any going back to normal until we have a vaccine or effective medication. I\u2019m just asking for seminormal. The alternative is just a nonstarter. An underground economy would begin to emerge as people became more desperate. Breaking quarantine rules would become more widespread, and so, probably, would crime.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the desperation of our undocumented population, much of which was already living paycheck to paycheck and won\u2019t have ready access to government benefits.\n\nGail: As I said, we\u2019ve got to have a charitable infrastructure with enough funds to take care of the undocumented and the people who\u2019ve been working under the table.\n\nBret: I agree: That\u2019s essential. I just think we\u2019re inevitably going to have to accept some risks in order to mitigate others. We should maintain bans on large gatherings, like concerts or sports events. We need wide-scale antibody testing, so that people who have had the virus and are probably immune from it can, whenever possible, get back to work. We ought to enforce strict quarantine rules on people with the virus, including imposing fines or criminal penalties. And we need to preserve a culture of social distancing wherever possible, so that we all just get in the habit of staying six feet apart no matter where we are, and of wearing face masks as a matter of routine, and of keeping disposable gloves handy.\n\nGail: Well we agree on the widespread testing. Once we have it, things are going to change. And although you don\u2019t have to go into it now, I know you agree with me about whose fault it is that we weren\u2019t better prepared.", "[Read our guide on how to keep a clean (enough) house with kids.]\n\nWhen I succumb to the grip of parental comparison, I start to believe that I\u2019m less valuable because of my laissez-faire tendencies. It doesn\u2019t help that our culture favors effortlessly efficient parents. Our 21st century version of motherhood has not evolved as much as we\u2019d like to think beyond 1950\u2019s archetypes. Instead of \u201cToday\u2019s Woman: The magazine for young wives\u201d touting the perfect patterned dishware, we have picture-perfect Instagram influencers and online magazines telling us to Marie Kondo, or else. What you don\u2019t see are articles lauding the benefits of ditching schedules, or tossing your shoes into the closet willy-nilly. But that\u2019s who I am, and the harder I try to change, the more stubbornly my proclivity toward chaos trends.\n\nI know that I\u2019ll never be the parent who cuts cucumbers into star shapes for perfectly organized bento boxes, but I do crave a sense of stability \u2014 of knowing what comes next. I don\u2019t want to be late to drop my daughter off at preschool every day, and I don\u2019t want to keep forgetting those darn diapers, either.\n\nSo I enlisted some help in my quest to get a better handle on my family\u2019s domestic life.\n\nEileen Kennedy-Moore, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and author of \u201cKid Confidence: Help Your Child Make Friends, Build Resilience, and Develop Real Self-Esteem\u201d chatted with me about some of my tendencies toward disorganization. \u201cIt may be harder for you to keep a schedule, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re incapable of doing it,\u201d she said. It\u2019s important not to rely on willpower when trying to make changes to your routine, she emphasized, because willpower gets easily depleted.\n\nDr. Kennedy-Moore suggested that I start small, and choose one area that I\u2019d like to work on. For example, if I don\u2019t typically remember to pack diapers in my bag, I may decide that I cannot brush my teeth in the morning until I\u2019ve packed what I need. Linking one morning ritual that I never forget to a morning habit that I often forget may lead to success.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m pigeonholing myself, anyway. There\u2019s little scientific foundation behind Type A and Type B personalities, Dr. Kennedy-Moore said, but we all have tendencies based on inborn temperament and experience. While putting people into two neat personality boxes likely isn\u2019t sufficient, it does make it easy to differentiate between those of us who are typically more organized and people, like me, who aren\u2019t. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to say that we are doomed,\u201d she cautioned. We should be gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes or our plans don\u2019t work out, she added. If I forget to pack diapers even after establishing a new routine, I shouldn\u2019t label myself as a failure \u2014 perhaps that plan just wasn\u2019t a good fit, or I need more practice.", "BRISTOL, N.H. \u2014 The coronavirus itself was slow to arrive in Bristol, a lakeside town of 3,300 people. The economic destruction came swiftly.\n\nBy the end of March, with just a few local cases confirmed, gift shops, yoga studios and restaurants had all shut their doors. Hundreds lost jobs, contributing to a record surge in national unemployment claims.\n\nBut at least the Freudenberg factory was running at full strength. The factory, which employs 350 people and makes bonded piston seals and other components for carmakers around the world, has an outsize impact on Bristol\u2019s economy.\n\nBesides paying employees their salaries and the town taxes, the factory \u2014 part of a German industrial conglomerate \u2014 is the largest customer of Bristol\u2019s sewage and water systems, a linchpin of the annual budget.", "Ms. Cooley said that when the company realized the extent of the misunderstanding, its employees were very upset. After all, their intentions were good. Two hundred fifty teachers were made very happy.\n\nBut while it is true that the company is small, Ms. Witherspoon herself is big, maybe even \u201cone of the most powerful people in Hollywood.\u201d In good times, that perception benefits her brand. It probably is part of what convinced her to enter the fashion arena in the first place, monetizing her image and following in the footsteps of Gwyneth Paltrow at Goop, Jessica Alba at the Honest Company and Kate Hudson at Fabletics. It also created a disjunction between perception and reality that contributed to misconceptions.\n\nIt would not have seemed out of the realm of possibility to many teachers, who as of May 2019 had a median annual income of $59,670 (per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), with the lowest 10 percent making only $39,020, that Ms. Witherspoon, whose most recent pay rate was reported to be $2 million an episode for \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV, was giving everyone who applied a dress.\n\nAssuming she was giving away her cheapest dress, which sells for $78, and if the cost of that dress to her company is, say, $40, which takes into account the average wholesale margin, that would have meant spending something like $40 million on the giveaway.\n\nThis is a time when \u2014 thanks in part to social media \u2014 the cult of personality that attaches to a founder is often conflated with the company they run. Giving away $40 million in dresses may even have seemed in character, at least as far as this public character went. Ms. Witherspoon is a very plausible dream benefactor, swooping in to do something entirely unexpected and joy-giving.\n\n\u201cShe always seemed like such a down-to-earth celebrity,\u201d said Laura Deckman, Mr. Carroll\u2019s sister and a teacher in the Rochester, N.Y., public school system, who said she followed Ms. Witherspoon on Instagram. \u201cShe has a really strong brand that is about being a mom and regular person.\u201d", "Mom didn\u2019t have money for babysitters, and sometimes when I was as young as 6, I was left alone to watch my little brother. We survived, but in truth, 6-year-olds make pretty terrible babysitters. I once sent my own 6-year-old downstairs alone so I could get another half-hour of sleep, but I was soon awoken by a high-pitched scream. My daughter, set on making me breakfast in bed, had coated the kitchen floor with olive oil so that she could rollerblade more swiftly while making waffles. It did not end well.\n\nMy kids are living a distinctly different childhood from my own. They\u2019ve had the same friends since preschool, a posse that moves together sure-footedly through lost teeth and first crushes and learning how to read and ride their bikes. My family had moved 15 times by the time I was in high school. We changed towns so often that I more or less stopped making friends for fear of losing them, and I never really grew to know any place to be a home. I was too ashamed to bring schoolmates home \u2014 at 10, I would never have considered letting the other fifth graders into the strange-smelling, windowless, shower-less room that we sheltered in that winter.\n\nBut, even when we were squatting in an office space or hitching across the country, my mother managed to create a sense of home around meals. Whether she was cooking chicken soup on an electric hot plate or we were sitting on a log eating eggplant parmesan prepared on a campfire, Mom fed us with thoughtful attention. She showed her love daily through the food she cooked. Dinner was our anchor \u2014 consistent and soothing, it knit the three of us together, it made our little world feel safe.", "During a 2017 interview with the similarly controversial podcast host Sam Harris, Murray said:\n\nOne of the things that struck me most were people who say, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. We don\u2019t particularly like Donald Trump. We are not defending his character, or anything like that. He\u2019s our murder weapon.\u201d And I think that is a pretty short and accurate way of saying what function Trump served.\n\nAccording to Murray, \u201cthe \u2018deplorables\u2019 comment by Hillary Clinton may have changed the history of the world.\u201d That comment,\n\nall by itself, might have swung enough votes. It certainly was emblematic of the disdain with which the new upper class looks at mainstream America, and mainstream America notices this.\n\nUsing Murray\u2019s portrayal of Belmont, Mass. as the epitome of the liberal elite, and the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia as representative of white working class communities, Niall Ferguson, a professor of history at Harvard, described Murray\u2019s assessment of Trump in an article written during the 2016 campaign:\n\nThe prevailing mood among Clinton loyalists is one of confidence that they will win. The bookies give her a 68 percent probability of being the next president. The mainstream media are also on board, spewing indignation after Trump called on the Russians to help find Clinton\u2019s missing emails. And yet. For a year, commentators have made the mistake of thinking that things they find outrageous are also outrageous to a majority of voters. But top journalists live in Belmont. They just don\u2019t get what Fishtown folk find outrageous.\n\nNevertheless, there are some worrisome indicators for Trump.\n\nAfter an initial rise in his favorability ratings during the last two weeks of March, positive feelings toward Trump have slowly eroded.\n\nNick Gourevitch, partner and managing director of the Democratic polling firm Global Strategies and a principal in the Democratic polling consortium Navigator Research, has been closely following trends since the coronavirus outbreak began. He emailed the following analysis:\n\nOur first tracker was released March 23rd, which coincided with a period of time after Trump stopped downplaying the virus as much. At that time (March 23rd), we saw his overall approval at minus 2 \u2014 47 percent approve to 49 percent disapprove \u2014 which was unusually high for him.\u201d Since then \u201cthe generic job approval started to slip and is now minus 5.\n\nBeyond the job ratings, Gourevitch continued,\n\nVoters remain incredibly sour on his early response to the outbreak with 62 percent saying he did not take it seriously enough to start and 28 percent saying he got it about right.\n\nIn addition, according to Gourevitch,\n\nA majority of voters ascribe negative traits to him as well, including 60 percent who say he is unprepared, 59 percent self-absorbed, and 55 percent chaotic.\n\nOne of the crucial questions going into the 2020 election is whether unemployment and widespread financial distress will lift or depress turnout, which groups will cast votes and which will not.\n\nThe competition between Republicans and Democrats to place blame on the opposition for the pandemic has already become a central element of the presidential campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign, as Jonathan Swan at Axios writes, has made it clear that it plans to \u201cHit Biden as \u2018soft\u2019 on China.\u201d A Trump digital ad released earlier this month claims that \u201cBiden stands up for China while China cripples America.\u201d", "I suggested we make it a nightly habit \u2014 folding a crane or two, aiming for 1,000. In Japan, families and friends sometimes fold a thousand cranes \u2014 senbazuru \u2014 to give to someone who is ill, to wish them a speedy recovery. My mother folded 1,000 cranes for my husband\u2019s and my wedding, for luck. Maybe by the time we get to 1,000, there will be a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nWe\u2019ve been going only for a few nights so far. Sometimes I still have to ask my 13-year-old son to remind me what step comes next. My edges are not always crisp as I would like. The folds are slightly off kilter. My cranes are not nearly as graceful as my daughter\u2019s. We place our finished birds on a cherry wood tray carved by my mother, who is far away, under lockdown with my father in California. It is calming, this act of folding together.\n\nSublime notes\n\nTaffy Brodesser-Akner, Times Magazine staff writer\n\nI\u2019ve seen some beautiful things: People coming together, the healthy checking on the sick, the able grocery shopping for the stricken, applause for medical workers, but the thing that has stayed with me the most was two weeks ago, when the bat mitzvah of my dear friends\u2019 daughter, Rose, was canceled. The synagogue was shut and her grandparents and family (and us) couldn\u2019t get on a plane from New York to see her. A few of the women who are part of the women-only theater group that mounts a musical every year each recorded, synchronized and edited the extremely melodic introduction to the ceremony of calling her up to the Torah. It was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen, and just like that, the story of a girl\u2019s canceled bat mitzvah became the story of how much everyone loved her and went out of their way to show it that weekend.", "Another doctor notices the bewilderment on my face and comes over. \u201cThere are people literally dying of hypoxia in the hallways,\u201d he says, \u201cand there\u2019s empty space with oxygen dispensers on the wall and no one using them.\u201d What is he talking about? Isn\u2019t the hospital full? He suggests that I take a walk down the hall and make a right, less than 100 yards away.\n\nI swipe open the unit, which usually serves as a post\u00adoperative area, with my ID. I see a room about half the size of the E.R. It\u2019s a Sunday, a slow day usually, but still, there\u2019s only one patient, who\u2019s being tended to by a nursing assistant. A nurse hovers nearby. I track the green oxygen dispensers on the walls, these fountains of life that my patients gravely need. I go upstairs to one of the regular floors. It\u2019s calm and quiet. Unlike in the E.R., where I dodge patients, colleagues and stretchers to get around \u2014 forget six feet of separation; we\u2019re not able to maintain six inches \u2014 here the hallways are free and unobstructed. It\u2019s just a regular hospital floor, but the space feels glorious, luxurious.\n\nIt\u2019s the first day of our pulse-ox to-go program. Until this point, I have been opposed to the idea of sending hypoxic patients home with pulse oximeters, especially after learning from the Italian doctors that their oxygen numbers often drop quickly to life-threatening levels \u2014 sometimes before the patients feel it. These guidelines seem too unsafe to me. A colleague begs me to rethink this, telling me they will get better care at home with their family members than here in the E.R., at least in its current state. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying this as someone who doesn\u2019t believe in these guidelines,\u201d he adds. After witnessing how many patients are suffering in the E.R., I immediately discharge two to self-monitor. I know I\u2019ll probably soon hear the dreaded words \u2014 \u201cYou know that patient you sent home the other day? \u2026 \u201d \u2014 but I have to do what\u2019s best for them right now, with what I have in front of me. I\u2019m hopeful that the field hospital being built at Columbia University\u2019s soccer facility, to be staffed largely by former military personnel, will open soon with a capacity for nearly 300 patients.\n\nThis week, our employee-health services is at last starting to routinely test medical workers who develop symptoms that could be Covid-related. Still, I wish we could regularly get swabbed and checked when we know we have been exposed, even those of us without symptoms, so that we don\u2019t inadvertently pass it on to our patients. Some of us are also eager for antibody testing, seeking a sense of security if we end up having antibodies, though it\u2019s probably too early to say whether or for how long that could actually provide immunity.\n\nIn the E.R., I run into two co-workers who have recovered from the virus and are back at work. Our E.R. colleague across town is out of the I.C.U. I look at a photo of her eating and smiling on Facebook. The next day, I see on Twitter that James Pruden, a 70-year-old doctor in New Jersey, is leaving the hospital after spending nearly a month in the I.C.U. He was one of the first doctors hospitalized for coronavirus infection in the United States. I didn\u2019t think he would make it, because of his age and how sick he seemed. In a video clip, Pruden, in a blue dress shirt, is wheeled out on a stretcher and points energetically at the surrounding crowd. I\u2019ve never met him, but I\u2019m immediately tearful. I replay the recording four more times. Then I send the tweet to a colleague who works with him. \u201cSomething going our way for a change,\u201d he responds. \u201cIf he can do this, we sure can.\u201d\n\nLater that same day, though, I get a text that several more of our E.R. staff members are hospitalized, requiring oxygen. I learn that another died a few days earlier. More co-workers are ill at home with symptoms. At night, I open an email that a doctor in Brooklyn forwarded to me with the names of more health care workers in New York City who have died. I hadn\u2019t even heard of their deaths.\n\nOver the next several days, I notice the tone changing during my shifts. Conversations about dying and death are all around me now, the only kind I hear. Either I am having one or the physician next to me is. We spend our days talking to patients and families about the limits of medicine and what doctors can do; we call people to tell them their loved ones have passed away. Then we make another call.

I would wake up, go into my work space and get myself all set up to work on a project \u2014 only to find that my brain had become a big pile of mush. I would play songs that, pre-pregnancy, I had been inspired to work on, and feel totally blank. I would try to think about fixes to scripts I was working on and become exhausted. Nothing like any of this had ever happened to me before.\n\nThis new sense of creative impotence was scarier than any other symptom of pregnancy I had experienced thus far. It was also bewildering, since no one had mentioned this as a possibility. I know, of course, that some women stop working late in their pregnancies for the sake of their physical well-being. But imagine getting pregnant and immediately finding that you can\u2019t do your job \u2014 which is also the thing that gives you pleasure and a sense of purpose, and forms a large part of your identity?\n\nIt was terrifying.

Once we unpacked the situation, she helped me understand that the loss of my creative drive did seem to coincide with pregnancy and that I probably hadn\u2019t lost it forever. We agreed that while I wasn\u2019t experiencing full-blown depression, my inability to create was seriously affecting my happiness, compounded by the fact that I had few distractions or productive activities to fill my time.

But that\u2019s who I am, and the harder I try to change, the more stubbornly my proclivity toward chaos trends.\n\nI know that I\u2019ll never be the parent who cuts cucumbers into star shapes for perfectly organized bento boxes, but I do crave a sense of stability \u2014 of knowing what comes next. I don\u2019t want to be late to drop my daughter off at preschool every day, and I don\u2019t want to keep forgetting those darn diapers, either.\n\nSo I enlisted some help in my quest to get a better handle on my family\u2019s domestic life.\n\nEileen Kennedy-Moore, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and author of \u201cKid Confidence: Help Your Child Make Friends, Build Resilience, and Develop Real Self-Esteem\u201d chatted with me about some of my tendencies toward disorganization. \u201cIt may be harder for you to keep a schedule, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re incapable of doing it,\u201d she said. It\u2019s important not to rely on willpower when trying to make changes to your routine, she emphasized, because willpower gets easily depleted.\n\nDr. Kennedy-Moore suggested that I start small, and choose one area that I\u2019d like to work on. For example, if I don\u2019t typically remember to pack diapers in my bag, I may decide that I cannot brush my teeth in the morning until I\u2019ve packed what I need. Linking one morning ritual that I never forget to a morning habit that I often forget may lead to success.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m pigeonholing myself, anyway. There\u2019s little scientific foundation behind Type A and Type B personalities, Dr. Kennedy-Moore said, but we all have tendencies based on inborn temperament and experience. While putting people into two neat personality boxes likely isn\u2019t sufficient, it does make it easy to differentiate between those of us who are typically more organized and people, like me, who aren\u2019t. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to say that we are doomed,\u201d she cautioned. We should be gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes or our plans don\u2019t work out, she added. If I forget to pack diapers even after establishing a new routine, I shouldn\u2019t label myself as a failure \u2014 perhaps that plan just wasn\u2019t a good fit, or I need more practice.", "Ms. Cooley said that when the company realized the extent of the misunderstanding, its employees were very upset. After all, their intentions were good. Two hundred fifty teachers were made very happy.\n\nBut while it is true that the company is small, Ms. Witherspoon herself is big, maybe even \u201cone of the most powerful people in Hollywood.\u201d In good times, that perception benefits her brand. It probably is part of what convinced her to enter the fashion arena in the first place, monetizing her image and following in the footsteps of Gwyneth Paltrow at Goop, Jessica Alba at the Honest Company and Kate Hudson at Fabletics. It also created a disjunction between perception and reality that contributed to misconceptions.\n\nIt would not have seemed out of the realm of possibility to many teachers, who as of May 2019 had a median annual income of $59,670 (per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), with the lowest 10 percent making only $39,020, that Ms. Witherspoon, whose most recent pay rate was reported to be $2 million an episode for \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV, was giving everyone who applied a dress.\n\nAssuming she was giving away her cheapest dress, which sells for $78, and if the cost of that dress to her company is, say, $40, which takes into account the average wholesale margin, that would have meant spending something like $40 million on the giveaway.\n\nThis is a time when \u2014 thanks in part to social media \u2014 the cult of personality that attaches to a founder is often conflated with the company they run. Giving away $40 million in dresses may even have seemed in character, at least as far as this public character went. Ms. Witherspoon is a very plausible dream benefactor, swooping in to do something entirely unexpected and joy-giving.\n\n\u201cShe always seemed like such a down-to-earth celebrity,\u201d said Laura Deckman, Mr. Carroll\u2019s sister and a teacher in the Rochester, N.Y., public school system, who said she followed Ms. Witherspoon on Instagram. \u201cShe has a really strong brand that is about being a mom and regular person.\u201d", "The excitement led me to swipe right on a photo of a woman named Joanne, biting a fur coat. She was the first person I would love as my true self and the first person to love me back after I transitioned. With childlike innocence, we battled the difficulties and discrimination many queer couples face. Our love made us inseparable and I wanted to share all of myself with Joanne. But, from the beginning, it seemed there was one thing we would never share: a biological child.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, while watching Moonraker on Netflix, Joanne fell asleep in my lap. As I ran my fingers through her hair, I began imagining a small child with the same brown curls, a child who loved the beach like Joanne and who, like me, wanted to make art. I decided in that moment that I would do anything to bring that child into the world.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I struggled to find information about transgender people in my situation, who\u2019d interrupted their medical transitions in order to have children. Most of the examples I found, of transgender people who\u2019d had biological children, were online or in documentaries. These included children who came before transition, transgender men who became pregnant after stopping testosterone, and children conceived with sperm stored before the transition process. My doctors warned me that even after a yearlong reintroduction of testosterone, Joanne and I still might not be able to have a child. No one really knew how long I might need to stay off hormones.\n\nThat year passed and, going through puberty yet again, testosterone changed my body and mind. I didn\u2019t recognize myself physically or emotionally. I\u2019d become introverted, easily angered, wound up by anxiety and severe depression. The bustle, aggression and constant change of New York City seemed to mirror my tormented emotions and the endless construction site my body had become.\n\nOne night last summer, I met Joanne at an all-transgender cabaret show. A trans woman in a sultry red dress began to sing \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d Midway through her performance, she revealed an estrogen-filled syringe hidden in her bra. I watched as she injected it into her thigh, flaunting her use of the same hormone that had once allowed me to be myself.", "Mom didn\u2019t have money for babysitters, and sometimes when I was as young as 6, I was left alone to watch my little brother. We survived, but in truth, 6-year-olds make pretty terrible babysitters. I once sent my own 6-year-old downstairs alone so I could get another half-hour of sleep, but I was soon awoken by a high-pitched scream. My daughter, set on making me breakfast in bed, had coated the kitchen floor with olive oil so that she could rollerblade more swiftly while making waffles. It did not end well.\n\nMy kids are living a distinctly different childhood from my own. They\u2019ve had the same friends since preschool, a posse that moves together sure-footedly through lost teeth and first crushes and learning how to read and ride their bikes. My family had moved 15 times by the time I was in high school. We changed towns so often that I more or less stopped making friends for fear of losing them, and I never really grew to know any place to be a home. I was too ashamed to bring schoolmates home \u2014 at 10, I would never have considered letting the other fifth graders into the strange-smelling, windowless, shower-less room that we sheltered in that winter.\n\nBut, even when we were squatting in an office space or hitching across the country, my mother managed to create a sense of home around meals. Whether she was cooking chicken soup on an electric hot plate or we were sitting on a log eating eggplant parmesan prepared on a campfire, Mom fed us with thoughtful attention. She showed her love daily through the food she cooked. Dinner was our anchor \u2014 consistent and soothing, it knit the three of us together, it made our little world feel safe.", "Though I didn\u2019t know it at the time, my crying fits at home and in the hospital were autistic meltdowns. I would find out many months later that what I had experienced was a cycle of sporadic hemiplegic migraines, which can lead to a coma or, in rare cases, even death. I often wonder if I would have been treated differently by medical staff if I had had an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis then, or if I still would have been dismissed as an anxious woman who didn\u2019t know how to manage her pain.\n\nResearch also suggests that undiagnosed autism has been harmful for women. In a 2016 study of 14 women, \u201cmany told us that the fact that their autism went unrecognized for so long had a very real and negative impact upon their mental health,\u201d said Dr. William Mandy, D.Clin.Psy., Ph.D., an associate professor in clinical psychology at University College London. \u201cA lack of a diagnosis means a lack of appropriately targeted support, which can place an autistic individual under huge stress.\u201d\n\nThe published research on the experiences of autistic mothers is very limited. Two small qualitative studies in 2016 and 2017 consider pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. The interviews of autistic mothers in these studies reveal challenges they had with sensory issues during breastfeeding and childbirth, and adapting to motherhood and infant care. Many said they felt unfairly judged by midwives and other caregivers on parenting skills and decisions.\n\nDr. Simon Baron-Cohen, Ph.D., a professor of developmental psychopathology and the director of the Autism Research Center at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues have multiple studies underway to investigate the experience of autistic motherhood beyond the perinatal period. Presented at the 2016 International Meeting for Autism Research, their unpublished research involved an online survey of more than 300 autistic mothers. The study found the majority of them had extreme anxiety when talking to professionals about their children, encountered disbelief when they disclosed their diagnosis to professionals and struggled with daily parenting tasks.\n\n\u201cIt should now be a routine requirement for autism researchers to collaborate with autistic people in every project,\u201d Dr. Baron-Cohen said. \u201cWithout the input of autistic mothers, we would have missed key issues\u201d \u2014 such as the fact that autistic mothers have increased rates of postnatal depression and have been falsely accused of Munchausen syndrome by proxy on the assumption that they were making up their children\u2019s autism. He hopes this research will lead to more awareness of autistic motherhood experiences and the development of policy documents to improve the \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d services available for autistic mothers.\n\n\u201cMany autistic women are highly attuned to their children,\u201d said Lana Grant, author of \u201cFrom Here to Maternity: Pregnancy and Motherhood on the Autism Spectrum,\u201d a book aimed at helping autistic mothers with the challenges of pregnancy and motherhood. \u201cThey may see their child struggling with the same things that they struggled with as a child. They read up on everything they can about a behavior or condition and then they go to the professionals for help.\u201d Instead, they are seen as \u201ctoo knowledgeable and hysterical,\u201d Grant said, and dismissed as trying to tell professionals how to do their job.\n\nShe was already the mother of five of her six children (three of whom are on the autism spectrum) when she got her autism diagnosis at 38. \u201cAutistic mothers are their own worst critics,\u201d Grant said. She recommends that autistic mothers find a support network of other mothers on the spectrum, including those who are \u201cout and proud\u201d on social media, like her.", "During a 2017 interview with the similarly controversial podcast host Sam Harris, Murray said:\n\nOne of the things that struck me most were people who say, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. We don\u2019t particularly like Donald Trump. We are not defending his character, or anything like that. He\u2019s our murder weapon.\u201d And I think that is a pretty short and accurate way of saying what function Trump served.\n\nAccording to Murray, \u201cthe \u2018deplorables\u2019 comment by Hillary Clinton may have changed the history of the world.\u201d That comment,\n\nall by itself, might have swung enough votes. It certainly was emblematic of the disdain with which the new upper class looks at mainstream America, and mainstream America notices this.\n\nUsing Murray\u2019s portrayal of Belmont, Mass. as the epitome of the liberal elite, and the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia as representative of white working class communities, Niall Ferguson, a professor of history at Harvard, described Murray\u2019s assessment of Trump in an article written during the 2016 campaign:\n\nThe prevailing mood among Clinton loyalists is one of confidence that they will win. The bookies give her a 68 percent probability of being the next president. The mainstream media are also on board, spewing indignation after Trump called on the Russians to help find Clinton\u2019s missing emails. And yet. For a year, commentators have made the mistake of thinking that things they find outrageous are also outrageous to a majority of voters. But top journalists live in Belmont. They just don\u2019t get what Fishtown folk find outrageous.\n\nNevertheless, there are some worrisome indicators for Trump.\n\nAfter an initial rise in his favorability ratings during the last two weeks of March, positive feelings toward Trump have slowly eroded.\n\nNick Gourevitch, partner and managing director of the Democratic polling firm Global Strategies and a principal in the Democratic polling consortium Navigator Research, has been closely following trends since the coronavirus outbreak began. He emailed the following analysis:\n\nOur first tracker was released March 23rd, which coincided with a period of time after Trump stopped downplaying the virus as much. At that time (March 23rd), we saw his overall approval at minus 2 \u2014 47 percent approve to 49 percent disapprove \u2014 which was unusually high for him.\u201d Since then \u201cthe generic job approval started to slip and is now minus 5.\n\nBeyond the job ratings, Gourevitch continued,\n\nVoters remain incredibly sour on his early response to the outbreak with 62 percent saying he did not take it seriously enough to start and 28 percent saying he got it about right.\n\nIn addition, according to Gourevitch,\n\nA majority of voters ascribe negative traits to him as well, including 60 percent who say he is unprepared, 59 percent self-absorbed, and 55 percent chaotic.\n\nOne of the crucial questions going into the 2020 election is whether unemployment and widespread financial distress will lift or depress turnout, which groups will cast votes and which will not.\n\nThe competition between Republicans and Democrats to place blame on the opposition for the pandemic has already become a central element of the presidential campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign, as Jonathan Swan at Axios writes, has made it clear that it plans to \u201cHit Biden as \u2018soft\u2019 on China.\u201d A Trump digital ad released earlier this month claims that \u201cBiden stands up for China while China cripples America.\u201d"], "20200416": ["Throughout the coronavirus outbreak, my mom and I have cooked numerous dishes for older people we know. We made lasagna, cake, soup, various treats, vegetable plates, and more. We do so to promote them to quarantine and eliminate any reason for them to leave the house. My mom also buys groceries for her parents and older friends. I try to lighten up my grandparents by calling them. I do other types of community service within my girl scout troop, including fundraisers, making blankets and for animals in shelters, and caroling to elders. On our own, my mom and I hand out water and granola bars to homeless people. The quote \u201cit\u2019s better to give than to receive\u201d does have some truth.

Masterman\n\nDonation efforts\n\nAs the world is going through a pandemic, our school decided to send a care package to three different hospitals in South Korea (that is where I live). We donated snacks, drinks, shampoo, soap and handmade cards. I am also growing my hair so I can donate it to make wigs for children with cancer. During easter our family and some other people brought masks and gave it to others in need.\n\n\u2014 Allison Go, South Korea\n\nRecently, my sister and I realized that our bookcases were full of books we had not read in years, either because we had already read them, or because they were children\u2019s books. With all the free time we had over the weekend, we decided to sort through our books and decide which ones to donate. We each ended up with huge piles of books, and we organized them into categories. At this point, we could have donated all of the books to some organization. However, we wanted to know exactly where our books were going so we could feel the effect of the deed more. My mom posted pictures of all of our books on the \u201cMoms of New Rochelle\u201d Facebook group with the caption \u201cfree books.\u201d She instantly began receiving messages from mothers who said their children were running out of books to read since the libraries are now closed. We messaged back and forth with some of the mothers, suggesting books for their children based on their ages and interests. Every mother expressed gratitude; one even asked how she could repay us, telling us she could send us gloves if we wanted. We refused, partly because we did not need gloves, but also partly because the good feeling we got from doing the deed was sufficient pay.\n\n\u2014 Daviel Schulman, New Rochelle, NY\n\nVolunteering\n\nDuring the coronavirus epidemic my church has supported homeless people by giving them food and items like a mask, hand sanitizer, and blankets to stay safe. Homeless people right now need as much help as possible to stay healthy during the pandemic. They don\u2019t have the money or the resources to stay afloat. I believe with everything that my church does can help them.\n\n\u2014 Izel, J.R. Masterman\n\nSince I can remember, my family\u2019s value system has been based on volunteering and helping others. I don\u2019t remember a season where my temple congregation was running an annual charity drive that my family did not help execute. Throughout my life I have renovated parks, run food donation trips, and organized clothing drives. Not only were these roles expected of me, it felt natural to spend my time giving to others. During the high holidays, I had the opportunity to donate over 500 bags of food to our local food kitchen with my youth group. Giving to others helped me realize that life was much bigger than what was right in front of me. The action of providing help, health and happiness to others filled me with a joy I had never experienced. I am lucky enough to be able to give onto others and it is one of the most valuable gifts one can achieve.\n\n\u2014 Hayden Roberge, New Rochelle, NY\n\nOne of my friends has an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. Many kids do a mitzvah protect for their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. A mitzvah project is a project that helps other people. My friend chose to do his at the Jewish Relief Agency (JRA). At the JRA, once a month, people come to a warehouse and help pack boxes with food. Then people deliver the boxes to people who need the food. I often went to help him pack and deliver boxes with him. I think that the act was incredibly beneficial to me because It helped me realize how many people need help in this world. This experience was also really fun. That made me realize that helping others can be as exciting for you as it is for the person you are helping sometimes\n\n\u2014 Jonah Smith Posner, J.R. Masterman\n\nSmall, but meaningful, gestures\n\nI haven\u2019t really been able to do too many things for people other than texting and calling people to let them know I\u2019ve been thinking of them. I have been trying to make an effort to talk to people I don\u2019t normally talk with, just offering a fun conversation to distract from the world. An act I have experienced is people I don\u2019t normally talk to reaching out to talk to me, and that meant a lot, and that is what inspired me to start doing the same.\n\n\u2014 Jamie, Healy, AK", "Find all our Lessons of the Day here.\n\nLesson Overview\n\nFeatured Article: \u201cLessons in Constructive Solitude From Thoreau\u201d by Holland Cotter\n\nOver 170 years ago, Henry David Thoreau used his self-quarantine at Walden Pond to pursue an intensive course in self-education. Mr. Cotter argues that in the present pandemic moment there\u2019s plenty to learn from standing still.\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about Thoreau and how his experience at Walden Pond is relevant today. In a Going Further activity, you will reflect upon your own experiences of solitude and consider how it might be valuable as a form of self-education.\n\nWarm Up\n\nDo you like to spend time alone? Why or why not?\n\nDo you enjoy a long, solitary walk in which you think through a complicated situation? Do you take pleasure in spending an hour sitting quietly at home when everyone else is out? Or do you find it hard to be alone, becoming bored or lonely, and something to avoid at all costs?\n\nReflect on your own experiences, then make a list of the benefits and the drawbacks of spending time alone: What can you learn about yourself and the world in solitude?", "How long have you lived in Tripoli?\n\nMy whole life until 2018, when I got to study at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. I visited Libya every summer and winter break, but during these extraordinary times and despite the ongoing conflict, I decided to go back home because I believe that home is a feeling, not only a place.\n\nIf this pandemic is going to be the end of the world, then I\u2019d rather die in my hometown next to my family.\n\nWhat are you seeing and hearing around you right now?\n\nLiving in Tripoli nowadays means hearing drones flying above your head most of the time. It means hearing projectiles falling around you. It means seeing and smelling smoke and polluted air when you open your window because of the places that get bombed.\n\nAnd finally, it means putting your earphones on whenever there is intensive shelling, so you can forget about the reality a little.\n\nThat\u2019s it for this briefing.

I think this was the very same slumber party where we desperately wanted to rent \u201cSpice World\u201d but all the copies were reserved, and my parents went to three different Blockbuster video stores to find it for us.\n\nThis was the first time I realized that my life wasn\u2019t private, and I was horrified. What if my friends stopped wanting to come over for play dates? What if they found out something even worse? (We were learning about puberty that year and everything felt gross and scary and embarrassing.)\n\nI came home from school that day and yelled at my dad across the kitchen island. I told him he never asked for permission to write about me, and he agreed that he wouldn\u2019t do it again without asking. I could tell he was disappointed to no longer have free rein to write about my childhood, though I never checked to see if he kept his promise.\n\nMany years later, he pestered me for weeks about submitting my wedding announcement to The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me,\u201d he begged. I pushed back, for the same reasons I did when I was 9. It was my wedding, my life, my call, and I didn\u2019t understand why he cared so much. He wasn\u2019t getting married. I eventually caved and, though I\u2019d never admit this to him, I\u2019ve re-read that announcement more than once. It\u2019s nice to see my fondest memory in print.\n\nSo here\u2019s the kicker. I\u2019m 32 now and a full-time writer. For more than a decade, I chose to share the details of my life in blog posts and essays. Yet I haven\u2019t written a single personal story in more than two years, because that\u2019s when June, my daughter, was born.\n\nThese days, the dilemma of how much to share about our children is no longer reserved for professional writers. The question facing my generation is: Should we post about our kids on social media? How much is too much? A 2010 study showed that more than 90 percent of 2-year-olds have an online presence and a quarter appear online before they\u2019re even born. By age 13, a report by the UK Children\u2019s Commissioner estimates, parents have already shared 1,300 photos and videos of their children.", "\u201cIf we don\u2019t become mindful of our use while we\u2019re around our very young children \u2014 our infants and our toddlers and our preschoolers \u2014 then that\u2019s very problematic because they rely on us so much to learn how relationships work, to feel cared for, to have their needs met,\u201d Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nThere are no blanket rules to follow: It might take some trial and error, and it\u2019s up to each family to figure out what works best. But here are a few techniques that may help you become more thoughtful and intentional about how you use your phone when you\u2019re with your children.\n\n[If you have a question about how technology affects kids, please submit it here.]\n\nTell your child what you\u2019re doing online.\n\nWhen we tap and scroll on our screens, children can no longer see and hear what we\u2019re doing: Context disappears, we gaze downward and our expressions go blank.\n\nSometimes that\u2019s O.K.\n\nChildren don\u2019t need to know everything, and obviously parents need to have private moments both online and offline. The difficulty comes when children start to feel shut out \u2014 as though the screen often takes precedence over their needs.\n\nTaking a bit of time to explain what you\u2019re doing on your phone can help children understand why you\u2019re distracted while also demonstrating that digital devices can be used in the context of relationships and problem solving.\n\nHere\u2019s how it might work: Imagine a hypothetical situation where you just picked up your child from day care and your partner texts to ask if you\u2019ll pick up dinner on the way home.\n\n\u201cYou can say to your child, \u2018Oh, Daddy asked us to stop at the supermarket and buy a chicken, let\u2019s write him back and tell him that we\u2019ll get a chicken for him.\u2019 And you can actually show the screen \u2014 just like with a storybook you can point at the words,\u201d said Rebecca Parlakian, the senior director of parenting programs at Zero to Three, a nonprofit research and training organization for early childhood development in Washington, D.C.", "Long before the coronavirus closed most of the world\u2019s playhouses, one company pioneered creating theater at a distance.\n\nThe Belarus Free Theater, founded in 2005 by dissident artists in the former Soviet republic, has operated clandestinely in the capital, Minsk, and in London, where the artistic directors, Natalia Kaliada and Nicolai Khalezin, have lived in exile since 2011.

I dove into his profile \u2014 a tall, dark and handsome scientist from New Orleans named Michael. He had tattoos of a M\u00f6bius strip and an electron orbital, and he liked to dance to Depeche Mode and the Kinks. We chatted effortlessly, our flirtation taking on an easy rhythm. We scheduled a date, on a Sunday at 4 p.m.\n\nI arrived 15 minutes late because my babysitter was delayed, my single-mom woes already interfering with my fragile dating persona. I rushed in, click-clacking my heels and apologizing profusely. Michael was sitting in a secluded booth, drinking a Scotch and sour, wearing a white button-up and a black vest. His sleeves were scrunched up, revealing his forearms. We enjoyed a fantastic dinner, then walked over to a tiny hole-in-the-wall comedy club, where we drank wine and laughed until tears stained our cheeks. Then we made out in his Cadillac until we fogged up the glass. It was magic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I designed you in a computer,\u201d Michael would say to me. He\u2019d stolen the line from a movie, but I didn\u2019t care; the feeling was mutual. We met as often as we could, but I had two babies to care for, and I didn\u2019t want to invite him over too soon. I didn\u2019t want to introduce someone I wasn\u2019t absolutely certain about to my little girls. I didn\u2019t want to drop the veil and let him see that \u201cEmily, the fabulous date\u201d was also \u201cEmily, the chaotic and scatterbrained single mom.\u201d It was all very nerve-racking, as there\u2019s no official rule book for situations like mine. What\u2019s a single mom to do?\n\nWhen my gut told me the time was right, I invited my new beau, along with some close friends, over for dinner so he could meet my daughters and my friends all at once. I figured the more people there were, the easier it would be to break the ice. When Michael arrived, one of my twins, Penny, walked right up and offered him a tiny hand to shake. Not long after, he started coming over to the house more frequently. The jig was up: He saw me as a whole rather than the fragment that came out on Saturdays.\n\nOne morning he called from work. \u201cI think I have pinkeye,\u201d he said. I was horrified. This is why single mothers should not date, I thought. Their babies give their boyfriends pinkeye \u2014 and everyone knows what causes pinkeye. A month after the pinkeye incident, he came down with hand, foot and mouth disease, another viral infection passed on by sweet but germy babies. He was so ill he had to miss work, had blisters covering his fingers, and lost a toenail.\n\nWhen Michael had recovered, he came to spend the night for the first time. He was walking through the house and, not watching his step, put his foot straight into the twins\u2019 freshly filled training potty. Pee splattered the walls, poo went flying, his foot and pant leg were soaked. I wanted to let out a scream or a laugh but couldn\u2019t find the breath for either.\n\nStill, Michael continued to come over, seemingly unfazed, with the patience of a saint, or maybe a guy falling in love. My daughters were growing accustomed to his visits and even missed him when he was gone. Sleepovers turned into four-day weekends, which turned into his landlord asking, \u201cDo you still live here?\u201d At that point we decided to take the plunge. He packed up his video game consoles, and we made his new address official.", "With a major holiday ahead, Japan broadens state of emergency\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan declared a nationwide state of emergency as coronavirus cases in the country continued a monthlong sharp rise that pushed its total past 8,000.\n\nThe move expands the emergency he declared for seven prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka. It gives governors the authority to call on businesses to close and residents to stay inside, but no enforcement power.\n\nMr. Abe acted ahead of Golden Week, a popular travel period.

I would wake up, go into my work space and get myself all set up to work on a project \u2014 only to find that my brain had become a big pile of mush. I would play songs that, pre-pregnancy, I had been inspired to work on, and feel totally blank. I would try to think about fixes to scripts I was working on and become exhausted. Nothing like any of this had ever happened to me before.\n\nThis new sense of creative impotence was scarier than any other symptom of pregnancy I had experienced thus far. It was also bewildering, since no one had mentioned this as a possibility. I know, of course, that some women stop working late in their pregnancies for the sake of their physical well-being. But imagine getting pregnant and immediately finding that you can\u2019t do your job \u2014 which is also the thing that gives you pleasure and a sense of purpose, and forms a large part of your identity?\n\nIt was terrifying. Was this normal? Would my creative drive ever come back? I had no idea, and that made me pretty depressed. I was also left with nothing to do for large chunks of time, which made me feel even more guilty about not working.\n\nI\u2019ve always been prone to anxiety and have spent the past few years learning to deal with it via therapy and meditation. I also knew that prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety are potentially serious issues. I\u2019ve had enough friends who have become mothers and suffered from mood disorders that I decided to see a therapist on the idea that, if this was the beginning of prenatal depression, I\u2019d at least get the jump on it.\n\nI sat down with a lovely therapist I found in New Zealand, where I am currently living, and explained my fears. Once we unpacked the situation, she helped me understand that the loss of my creative drive did seem to coincide with pregnancy and that I probably hadn\u2019t lost it forever. We agreed that while I wasn\u2019t experiencing full-blown depression, my inability to create was seriously affecting my happiness, compounded by the fact that I had few distractions or productive activities to fill my time. Simply understanding all this allowed me to cut myself some slack and even give myself permission to enjoy the boredom and solitude, knowing that, in the near future, I would rarely find myself alone or unoccupied.", "On March 18, he decided to accept the offer.

The news drained the energy in the room, stunning us into silence. The sound of butter sizzling in the frying pan filled the air, reminding us of the quesadillas we had planned to make.\n\nClint gazed through me, focusing on the fridge behind me, or maybe the long, uncertain road ahead.

That\u2019s how we felt our way through our grief, steadied our feet and set off on the path we now follow.", "The excitement led me to swipe right on a photo of a woman named Joanne, biting a fur coat. She was the first person I would love as my true self and the first person to love me back after I transitioned. With childlike innocence, we battled the difficulties and discrimination many queer couples face. Our love made us inseparable and I wanted to share all of myself with Joanne. But, from the beginning, it seemed there was one thing we would never share: a biological child.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, while watching Moonraker on Netflix, Joanne fell asleep in my lap. As I ran my fingers through her hair, I began imagining a small child with the same brown curls, a child who loved the beach like Joanne and who, like me, wanted to make art. I decided in that moment that I would do anything to bring that child into the world.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I struggled to find information about transgender people in my situation, who\u2019d interrupted their medical transitions in order to have children. Most of the examples I found, of transgender people who\u2019d had biological children, were online or in documentaries. These included children who came before transition, transgender men who became pregnant after stopping testosterone, and children conceived with sperm stored before the transition process. My doctors warned me that even after a yearlong reintroduction of testosterone, Joanne and I still might not be able to have a child. No one really knew how long I might need to stay off hormones.\n\nThat year passed and, going through puberty yet again, testosterone changed my body and mind. I didn\u2019t recognize myself physically or emotionally. I\u2019d become introverted, easily angered, wound up by anxiety and severe depression. The bustle, aggression and constant change of New York City seemed to mirror my tormented emotions and the endless construction site my body had become.\n\nOne night last summer, I met Joanne at an all-transgender cabaret show. A trans woman in a sultry red dress began to sing \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d Midway through her performance, she revealed an estrogen-filled syringe hidden in her bra. I watched as she injected it into her thigh, flaunting her use of the same hormone that had once allowed me to be myself.", "This story was originally published on Jan. 17, 2020 in NYT Parenting.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been pregnant, you probably know this routine: Every few weeks, you clear a couple of hours on your schedule for a prenatal checkup.\n\nYou sit in a waiting room. Maybe you scroll through a pregnancy app on your phone, but you probably don\u2019t strike up a conversation with the woman next to you. Maybe you make a list of your questions: How risky is deli meat, really? What\u2019s that stabbing pain in your side? Finally, a nurse calls your name and takes your blood pressure and weight. You wait some more. Another medical professional measures your belly, checks the fetal heart rate and, if all is well, you\u2019re done. That list of questions? Make it snappy.\n\n[Pregnancy pains got you down? Read this.]\n\nEven if everything is fine, prenatal care is seldom satisfying or particularly informative. But could prenatal care evolve to be more patient-centered \u2014 and maybe even more medically effective? That\u2019s the way some researchers and providers describe a new model called group prenatal care.", "You can also post a request through job boards at a local college, such as a nursing school, where students are looking for part-time, flexible work. The drawback is that their schedules change by semester or class.\n\nSeveral apps and websites also help parents find babysitters, including Care.com, UrbanSitter and others; within Facebook, you will most likely find local parenting groups where parents will recommend sitters. A caregiver staffing agency can also help you find vetted candidates, but at a cost.\n\nConsider experience, energy and engagement levels.\n\nExperience: What kind of experience do they have in infant care? This should not be their first time. Ideally, you want to find someone who has taken care of a child in your baby\u2019s age range.\n\nYour sitter should also have basic first aid and CPR training and know how to respond in an emergency. The American Red Cross offers both online and in-person classes for babysitting, child care, first aid and CPR. Those who complete it receive a certificate. Even family and friends should consider taking a first aid and CPR class, so that they\u2019re prepared for an emergency, said Dr. Angela Mattke, a pediatrician with the Mayo Clinic. You can offer to cover the cost of the class, or even join them for a refresher.\n\nEnergy: Taking care of a baby is exhausting. Particularly if you plan on relying on grandparents, you will want to assess their energy level. Take time to observe: Can they make it up and down the stairs without too much effort? Can they handle a squirmy baby, or change the diaper of a baby who is trying to roll over? Can they bend over and pick up the baby from the crib? If they plan to drive somewhere, can they get the baby into the carseat and buckle in the baby? Sometimes it may take both grandparents, working in tandem, to take care of the baby.\n\nEngagement: One way to assess if a sitter is a good fit is to have your baby with you during the interview. See how they interact with the baby. Do they get down on the floor and play with the baby? \u201cFrom 6 to 12 months, babies are learning early language skills by engaging with another human being,\u201d Dr. Mattke said. \u201cSo you need the babysitter\u2019s attention and for the babysitter not to be distracted by a cellphone or television.\u201d\n\nThe person taking care of your baby should also have strong communication skills, be open to taking direction from you and respond quickly on their feet.", "But the government was far less clear about how to relax restrictions later without causing another outbreak.\n\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary who is leading the British government while Prime Minister Boris Johnson recuperates from the virus, set out five prerequisites for easing restrictions, including a sustained and consistent decline in the daily death rates.\n\nWith 861 new deaths announced on Thursday \u2014 100 more than the day before \u2014 Britain appears far from meeting that prerequisite, as well as others that Mr. Raab outlined.\n\nTest blunder: The U.K. paid $20 million for new coronavirus tests from China in a global scramble for kits.

I would find out many months later that what I had experienced was a cycle of sporadic hemiplegic migraines, which can lead to a coma or, in rare cases, even death. I often wonder if I would have been treated differently by medical staff if I had had an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis then, or if I still would have been dismissed as an anxious woman who didn\u2019t know how to manage her pain.\n\nResearch also suggests that undiagnosed autism has been harmful for women. In a 2016 study of 14 women, \u201cmany told us that the fact that their autism went unrecognized for so long had a very real and negative impact upon their mental health,\u201d said Dr. William Mandy, D.Clin.Psy., Ph.D., an associate professor in clinical psychology at University College London. \u201cA lack of a diagnosis means a lack of appropriately targeted support, which can place an autistic individual under huge stress.\u201d\n\nThe published research on the experiences of autistic mothers is very limited. Two small qualitative studies in 2016 and 2017 consider pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. The interviews of autistic mothers in these studies reveal challenges they had with sensory issues during breastfeeding and childbirth, and adapting to motherhood and infant care. Many said they felt unfairly judged by midwives and other caregivers on parenting skills and decisions.\n\nDr. Simon Baron-Cohen, Ph.D., a professor of developmental psychopathology and the director of the Autism Research Center at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues have multiple studies underway to investigate the experience of autistic motherhood beyond the perinatal period. Presented at the 2016 International Meeting for Autism Research, their unpublished research involved an online survey of more than 300 autistic mothers. The study found the majority of them had extreme anxiety when talking to professionals about their children, encountered disbelief when they disclosed their diagnosis to professionals and struggled with daily parenting tasks.\n\n\u201cIt should now be a routine requirement for autism researchers to collaborate with autistic people in every project,\u201d Dr. Baron-Cohen said. \u201cWithout the input of autistic mothers, we would have missed key issues\u201d \u2014 such as the fact that autistic mothers have increased rates of postnatal depression and have been falsely accused of Munchausen syndrome by proxy on the assumption that they were making up their children\u2019s autism. He hopes this research will lead to more awareness of autistic motherhood experiences and the development of policy documents to improve the \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d services available for autistic mothers.\n\n\u201cMany autistic women are highly attuned to their children,\u201d said Lana Grant, author of \u201cFrom Here to Maternity: Pregnancy and Motherhood on the Autism Spectrum,\u201d a book aimed at helping autistic mothers with the challenges of pregnancy and motherhood. \u201cThey may see their child struggling with the same things that they struggled with as a child. They read up on everything they can about a behavior or condition and then they go to the professionals for help.\u201d Instead, they are seen as \u201ctoo knowledgeable and hysterical,\u201d Grant said, and dismissed as trying to tell professionals how to do their job.\n\nShe was already the mother of five of her six children (three of whom are on the autism spectrum) when she got her autism diagnosis at 38. \u201cAutistic mothers are their own worst critics,\u201d Grant said. She recommends that autistic mothers find a support network of other mothers on the spectrum, including those who are \u201cout and proud\u201d on social media, like her.", "Most multiples turn out fine but there are discomforts and risks.\n\nTwins are by far the most common multiples, and most twin pregnancies turn out fine. But multiple pregnancies are often more uncomfortable than singleton pregnancies. Higher levels of progesterone mean you\u2019ll be short of breath from the start, said Robinson, and first trimester exhaustion tends to be worse. Later in pregnancy, heartburn and back pain are often worse. And you\u2019re more likely to be constipated, again from the progesterone, which slows the movement of your intestines.\n\nThere\u2019s also a higher risk of complications. The most common is preterm labor (labor before 37 weeks), and the more babies you are carrying, the earlier they are likely to be born. Twins in the United States are born, on average, at 35.3 weeks gestation and weigh 5 pounds, 2 ounces; the average singleton baby in the United States is born at 38.7 weeks and weighs 7 pounds, 4 ounces. Multiple pregnancies are also more likely to lead to pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure) and gestational diabetes.\n\nKalish noted that bed rest should not be prescribed to avoid preterm labor. \u201cIt does not reduce the risk of preterm labor,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it can increase your risk,\u201d because of the increased chance of developing life-threatening blood clots. However, it can be appropriate for people with very high blood pressure.\n\nMultiple pregnancies also have a higher chance of miscarriage. One type is called vanishing twin syndrome, in which an early ultrasound detects two embryos but a later scan finds only one.\n\nWith some kinds of identical twins, there are higher risks for rare complications:\n\nAbout 10 to 15 percent of identical twins that share a placenta (called monochorionic twins) will develop a condition called twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which arises when the blood vessels inside their shared placenta direct more blood to one twin than to the other. If you\u2019re pregnant with monochorionic twins (about 70 percent of identical twins are monochorionic), you\u2019ll likely get ultrasounds every two weeks to check for this condition. Treatment options include early delivery or, at some specialized centers, closing off some placental blood vessels with lasers.\n\nIf your identical twins are monoamniotic, meaning they share an amniotic sac as well as a placenta (as 1 percent of identical twins do), their umbilical cords may become too tangled, which can flatten them like a garden hose and reduce or cut off the blood supply to one or both twins. This risk will also be monitored by ultrasound, and if found, providers may recommend early delivery.\n\nIf you\u2019re carrying monochorionic or monoamniotic twins, Robinson recommends (if possible) seeing a provider who specializes in maternal-fetal medicine, perinatology, or high-risk obstetrics, who will have more training and experience in finding and treating complications than a regular obstetrician.\n\nSee a lactation consultant before birth.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to try breastfeeding (with or without supplemental formula), Goodnight and Robinson both recommended seeing a lactation consultant before your babies are born. Breastfeeding twins is often successful but can be hard, they said, purely because of the logistics and time involved. In addition to seeing a lactation consultant, good nutrition, hydration and good social support can help with some of the challenges, said Goodnight. But don\u2019t beat yourself up if your multiples are not exclusively breastfed. They will be fine, Goodnight and Robinson said. Feeding your babies some breastmilk in combination with formula is still beneficial. \u201cI\u2019m a strong advocate to moms that it\u2019s tough having twins, so if we need to supplement to make everybody in the household function better, I would encourage that,\u201d said Goodnight of formula feeding. \u201cI\u2019m not supportive of shaming.\u201d\n\nPrepare for the postpartum period.\n\nNew parents of multiples are at higher risk for postpartum depression, \u201cI think because there\u2019s a higher chance that you have one or two babies that have to go to the NICU,\u201d said Kalish. \u201cYou also are probably more sleep-deprived.\u201d In Goodnight\u2019s experience, parents of multiples, even those who did not carry the pregnancy, describe \u201cmore marital stress, a slower return to work, financial stress, more sleep deprivation,\u201d he said. You don\u2019t need to fear developing postpartum depression just because you\u2019re pregnant with multiples, but if you know to look out for it, you might notice it and be able to get help sooner.\n\nGoodnight recommends that his patients begin setting up their social support networks about halfway through pregnancy (20 weeks), whether that\u2019s asking family or friends when they can come to help, asking a friend to set up a meal or chore train, or lining up a postpartum doula or night nurse. Looking for a group of other parents of multiples, either online or in person, can be helpful too, according to Ring. And getting a pediatrician lined up early in the third trimester, said Robinson, means you won\u2019t have to look for one while juggling two newborns even if you go into labor earlier than expected. If possible, choose one near you with easy parking or transit accessibility, because transporting multiple babies is harder.", "In June, following President Trump\u2019s call to end surprise billing, the Senate health committee approved a package of bills aiming to lower the cost of medical care, including a plan to end unexpected air ambulance bills \u2014 in part by requiring air ambulance companies to accept in-network rates from insurance companies.\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services, an industry trade group, says that air ambulance companies have high fixed costs including nurses, mechanics and pilots, and that this legislation would cause bases to close. There are about 550,000 air ambulance transports each year in the United States, according to the association\u2019s estimates.\n\n\u201cWe definitely want to find a solution that removes patients from the billing process, and does not result in balance billing, but also that preserves air ambulance services and ensures our ability to keep transporting those patients in need,\u201d said Christopher Eastlee, the vice president of government relations at the association.\n\nA 2017 report from the association found that the median cost of an air ambulance transport in 2015 was about $10,200, but providers don\u2019t always receive that amount. For example, Medicare, a federal insurance program for those over 65, paid a median of $5,998 per transport, the report said. Medicaid, a public health insurance program largely for low-income people, paid a median of $3,463. The uninsured paid about $354 out of pocket. To make up the deficit, the group says, those who are commercially insured must shoulder a greater burden. And that can lead to large bills that catch consumers by surprise.\n\n\u201cThe cost of uncompensated care can be tremendous and it is by far the largest component of any bill,\u201d Mr. Eastlee said. \u201cFor every single patient that doesn\u2019t pay the cost, those costs have to be shifted to the next patient. That is true of any health care endeavor.\u201d\n\nState legislators are also debating how to reduce air ambulance bills. Wyoming is seeking approval to use Medicaid to cover the state\u2019s medical air transportation, and Minnesota is considering a bill that would require providers to publish prices for their services. Florida, Maryland, New Mexico and North Dakota have also taken steps to educate the public about air ambulance balance billing.\n\nSome families, especially those who live in rural areas, pay for a yearly membership offered by some air ambulance providers, which covers costs that insurance doesn\u2019t pay. But patients don\u2019t typically get to choose which provider they use, so if a different company arrived at the scene during an emergency, the membership would offer no cost advantage.", "\u201cI have times when I\u2019m down or depressed because of the situation, but I probably keep them to myself a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, I could\u2019ve had a brain injury, so I\u2019m grateful for that.

Some in his sport make sure he remains included.\n\nJuan Pablo Gnecco, a Grand Prix rider, asked Babington to help evaluate more than 100 horses for an auction in February, where 17 horses, including one whose proceeds would go to Babington\u2019s foundation, were offered for sale. Babington watched video of the horses jumping and sent Gnecco a half-page write-up on each one. \u201cReally like this horse,\u201d he said about one chestnut 5-year-old. \u201cTechnique changes a little from jump to jump, but I don\u2019t mind because it\u2019s an effort to be careful.\u201d\n\nWhen Gnecco received the pages, he choked up.

The government of President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus controls most of the country, but has hostile relations with both the Kurdish-led administration that governs the northeast and the leaders of a rebel-held enclave in Idlib Province in the northwest.\n\nSyria has reported only 38 cases of coronavirus and two deaths, but aid groups have warned that the virus could do great damage.

The question facing my generation is: Should we post about our kids on social media? How much is too much? A 2010 study showed that more than 90 percent of 2-year-olds have an online presence and a quarter appear online before they\u2019re even born. By age 13, a report by the UK Children\u2019s Commissioner estimates, parents have already shared 1,300 photos and videos of their children.", "\u201cIf we don\u2019t become mindful of our use while we\u2019re around our very young children \u2014 our infants and our toddlers and our preschoolers \u2014 then that\u2019s very problematic because they rely on us so much to learn how relationships work, to feel cared for, to have their needs met,\u201d Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nThere are no blanket rules to follow: It might take some trial and error, and it\u2019s up to each family to figure out what works best. But here are a few techniques that may help you become more thoughtful and intentional about how you use your phone when you\u2019re with your children.\n\n[If you have a question about how technology affects kids, please submit it here.]\n\nTell your child what you\u2019re doing online.\n\nWhen we tap and scroll on our screens, children can no longer see and hear what we\u2019re doing: Context disappears, we gaze downward and our expressions go blank.\n\nSometimes that\u2019s O.K.\n\nChildren don\u2019t need to know everything, and obviously parents need to have private moments both online and offline. The difficulty comes when children start to feel shut out \u2014 as though the screen often takes precedence over their needs.\n\nTaking a bit of time to explain what you\u2019re doing on your phone can help children understand why you\u2019re distracted while also demonstrating that digital devices can be used in the context of relationships and problem solving.\n\nHere\u2019s how it might work: Imagine a hypothetical situation where you just picked up your child from day care and your partner texts to ask if you\u2019ll pick up dinner on the way home.\n\n\u201cYou can say to your child, \u2018Oh, Daddy asked us to stop at the supermarket and buy a chicken, let\u2019s write him back and tell him that we\u2019ll get a chicken for him.\u2019 And you can actually show the screen \u2014 just like with a storybook you can point at the words,\u201d said Rebecca Parlakian, the senior director of parenting programs at Zero to Three, a nonprofit research and training organization for early childhood development in Washington, D.C.", "Just as I was giving up on Tinder, I received a little \u201cping\u201d in my DM\u2019s: \u201cEmily, you\u2019ve got panache.\u201d Great word, even better compliment. I dove into his profile \u2014 a tall, dark and handsome scientist from New Orleans named Michael. He had tattoos of a M\u00f6bius strip and an electron orbital, and he liked to dance to Depeche Mode and the Kinks. We chatted effortlessly, our flirtation taking on an easy rhythm. We scheduled a date, on a Sunday at 4 p.m.\n\nI arrived 15 minutes late because my babysitter was delayed, my single-mom woes already interfering with my fragile dating persona. I rushed in, click-clacking my heels and apologizing profusely. Michael was sitting in a secluded booth, drinking a Scotch and sour, wearing a white button-up and a black vest. His sleeves were scrunched up, revealing his forearms. We enjoyed a fantastic dinner, then walked over to a tiny hole-in-the-wall comedy club, where we drank wine and laughed until tears stained our cheeks. Then we made out in his Cadillac until we fogged up the glass. It was magic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I designed you in a computer,\u201d Michael would say to me. He\u2019d stolen the line from a movie, but I didn\u2019t care; the feeling was mutual. We met as often as we could, but I had two babies to care for, and I didn\u2019t want to invite him over too soon. I didn\u2019t want to introduce someone I wasn\u2019t absolutely certain about to my little girls. I didn\u2019t want to drop the veil and let him see that \u201cEmily, the fabulous date\u201d was also \u201cEmily, the chaotic and scatterbrained single mom.\u201d It was all very nerve-racking, as there\u2019s no official rule book for situations like mine. What\u2019s a single mom to do?\n\nWhen my gut told me the time was right, I invited my new beau, along with some close friends, over for dinner so he could meet my daughters and my friends all at once. I figured the more people there were, the easier it would be to break the ice. When Michael arrived, one of my twins, Penny, walked right up and offered him a tiny hand to shake. Not long after, he started coming over to the house more frequently. The jig was up: He saw me as a whole rather than the fragment that came out on Saturdays.\n\nOne morning he called from work. \u201cI think I have pinkeye,\u201d he said. I was horrified. This is why single mothers should not date, I thought. Their babies give their boyfriends pinkeye \u2014 and everyone knows what causes pinkeye. A month after the pinkeye incident, he came down with hand, foot and mouth disease, another viral infection passed on by sweet but germy babies. He was so ill he had to miss work, had blisters covering his fingers, and lost a toenail.\n\nWhen Michael had recovered, he came to spend the night for the first time. He was walking through the house and, not watching his step, put his foot straight into the twins\u2019 freshly filled training potty. Pee splattered the walls, poo went flying, his foot and pant leg were soaked. I wanted to let out a scream or a laugh but couldn\u2019t find the breath for either.\n\nStill, Michael continued to come over, seemingly unfazed, with the patience of a saint, or maybe a guy falling in love. My daughters were growing accustomed to his visits and even missed him when he was gone. Sleepovers turned into four-day weekends, which turned into his landlord asking, \u201cDo you still live here?\u201d At that point we decided to take the plunge. He packed up his video game consoles, and we made his new address official.", "This story was originally published on June 19, 2019 in NYT Parenting.\n\nFor most kids, summer means freedom: a chance to take a break from the structured school day and to, well, let the good times roll. But for my 7-year-old son, Charlie, who has just finished kindergarten (a feat we weren\u2019t sure he would be able to accomplish in a mainstream classroom), the start of summer vacation this month has been a little heartbreaking.\n\nBecause of Charlie\u2019s cerebral palsy, he relies on a wheelchair to move and on a speaking device to talk. For these reasons alone, I feared his introduction to public school. I had heard horror stories from other special-needs parents \u2014 about kids unable to use the toilet coming home in diapers that had never been changed, kids ignored by teachers and peers and left to their own (extremely limited) resources. I worried that Charlie would not be able to connect with his kindergarten teacher or classroom aides. I knew that my son\u2019s receptive language skills \u2014 what he understands and absorbs \u2014 are above average. But because Charlie was still learning how to use his speaking device at the start of the school year, I worried that his intelligence would go unrecognized because no one would care enough to draw him out.\n\nLast August, on Charlie\u2019s first day of kindergarten, I waited with him in our driveway for the school bus to arrive. He was in his chair while I knelt by his side, a pose that is comforting to both of us. I told Charlie what I knew about his schedule for the day, reminded him of his new special education teacher\u2019s name and promised over and over that he would see me again that afternoon. When the bus arrived, I sent him off, doing my best to hide my sense of trepidation on his behalf.\n\nTo my surprise and relief, Charlie came home that afternoon exhausted, but happy. His bag overflowed with the crayon self-portraits his classmates had made to introduce themselves. Charlie had found a community that welcomed him, that was eager to engage with him and support him.", "If I.U.I. isn\u2019t successful, the next step is the more invasive I.V.F. procedure. In vitro fertilization is a \u201cshort-circuit\u201d of the system,\u201d said Dr. William B. Schoolcraft, M.D., founder and medical director of the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine. In a normal menstrual cycle, he said, a woman has to produce one egg, then that egg needs to \u201cget captured\u201d by the fallopian tube, then the sperm has to get there and fertilize the egg and that embryo has to make its five-day journey to the uterus. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of things that have to go right \u2014 with only one egg,\u201d Dr. Schoolcraft said. \u201cWe bypass the mechanical steps of natural conception or even I.U.I. and deliver the embryo directly to the uterus.\u201d\n\nDuring I.V.F., medication helps stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Then, your doctor will extract them, and embryologists in the laboratory will fertilize them with sperm in a petri dish. After three to five days, your doctor will transfer the resulting embryo or two into your uterus, and you will wait almost two weeks to see if it implants, resulting in a pregnancy.\n\nLearn your treatment options.\n\nBefore starting I.V.F., your doctor will decide on your individualized protocol: the type and amount of medication you\u2019ll need, when you\u2019ll need to take it and when you\u2019ll be scheduled for egg retrieval. Your doctor will consider things like your age, menstrual cycle regularity, ovarian reserve, B.M.I. and medical history, according to Dr. Eric Forman, M.D., the medical and laboratory director of Columbia University\u2019s Fertility Center in New York City. After your doctor decides on a protocol, you\u2019ll then get an ultrasound and bloodwork on day two or three of your cycle to assess your hormone levels and make sure you\u2019re ready to begin I.V.F. Then you will begin taking medication, Dr. Forman said, which can include:\n\nGonadotropins to get your ovaries to produce more eggs and grow those eggs at the same rate, so they\u2019ll be ready for retrieval at the same time.\n\nAntagonists to make sure you don\u2019t ovulate on your own.\n\nA trigger shot to make you ovulate.\n\nAfter about eight to 10 nights of medication, Dr. Forman said, when your eggs are mature, your doctor will prescribe the trigger shot and then proceed to the egg retrieval about 36 hours later.\n\nRight before retrieval is a good time to think about or ask some questions, such as:\n\nWill I be getting local or general anesthesia? Some clinics make that decision based on the number of eggs you have. If you only have a few, they might do local.\n\nAre you using fresh or frozen sperm? If you have a limited amount of frozen sperm, because you purchased it or it had to be extracted via surgery, discuss how much of it will be defrosted. Fresh sperm should be used within an hour after its produced.\n\nWill you be doing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (I.C.S.I.)? With standard I.V.F., an embryologist puts some 50,000 to 100,000 sperm into a petri dish with an egg and hopes the egg fertilizes. I.C.S.I., which involves microinjecting one sperm into an egg to create the embryo, is typically recommended if you\u2019re dealing with male factor infertility (because you have few or slow sperm) or if you\u2019re using donor sperm (because it\u2019s limited). Doctors may not use I.C.S.I. for your first I.V.F. cycle, but you can sign up for \u201cemergency I.C.S.I.\u201d to be used in that cycle in case no eggs fertilize with the standard protocol.\n\nAre you going to do a fresh embryo transfer? While some doctors prefer to transfer a \u201cfresh\u201d embryo a few days after egg retrieval, others prefer to freeze all the embryos to transfer in later cycles. Doctors who advocate for frozen transfers believe that it will give your body a chance to recover from the retrieval process. However, some say freezing harms embryos, so if you are a \u201cpoor responder,\u201d meaning you haven\u2019t produced a lot of eggs or embryos, you may need to do a fresh transfer.\n\nWill it be a day-three or a day-five transfer? Most clinics prefer to transfer embryos five days after egg retrieval, believing that the longer an embryo survives, the stronger it is. But if a woman is older, did not produce a lot of eggs or there is reason to believe her embryos may not survive, some clinics will transfer after three days. Studies show that day-five embryos have about a 51 percent chance of implantation, while day-three embryos have a 30 percent chance.\n\nHow many embryos will you transfer ? In the past, I.V.F. produced many twins and triplets because doctors were transferring multiple embryos. Today, due to better technology, doctors are able to select fewer, healthier embryos to reduce the chance of multiples. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends transferring as few embryos as necessary for one healthy baby.\n\nWill you be testing embryos? Pre-implantation genetic testing (P.G.T.) can be used to ascertain which of your embryos are chromosomally normal before transferring them. If you decide to test your embryos, they will be biopsied, then frozen at least until your next cycle, so a fresh transfer is not an option. Keep in mind, however, that some doctors believe that P.G.T. is not effective and cannot discern healthy embryos from bad ones.\n\nKnow the health risks of I.V.F.\n\nOne of the biggest risks of I.V.F. is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a sometimes painful condition that can be caused by medications that stimulate egg growth too well, causing enlarged ovaries, fluid retention and weight gain. It can be controlled by giving less medicine, especially to young and highly fertile women.\n\nOther side effects from I.V.F. medications can include cysts, abdominal pain, local skin reactions from the injections, mood swings, nausea, and headaches, said Dr. Forman, noting that many women have few side effects.\n\nWhile there is a correlation between infertility and increased risks of breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers, there is no solid evidence that infertility drugs themselves cause cancer. According to a 2018 review of the evidence in the journal Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology, \u201cWhile infertility per se is a risk factor for some female cancers, including breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, most studies do not show a significant risk of these cancers with the use of fertility medications.\u201d The review found that some studies have shown a \u201cpossible increased relative risk of borderline ovarian cancer,\u201d but the increased absolute risk is \u201csmall without a clear causal relationship.\u201d Ask your doctor about the potential health risks of I.V.F.\n\nGet emotional support.\n\nSocial support is important during this physically and emotionally challenging time, whether it comes from your partner, friends, online communities, group therapy or private counseling.", "The challenge for Ms. Mitchell and her colleagues at Athena is to make the Amazon buying experience a little less simple than Amazon wants it to be \u2014 to remind shoppers that there are real-world consequences when they tap Amazon\u2019s yellow checkout button.\n\n\u201cThe company has tried for years to brand their operation as internet magic,\u201d said Maurice BP-Weeks, co-executive director of Action Center on Race and the Economy, a Chicago-based member of the Athena coalition. \u201cLook for what you need, click and it\u2019s there in front of you. What we\u2019re learning is that there are an awful lot of people who aren\u2019t always treated too well who make that happen.\u201d\n\nThe welfare of Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers, previously a subject of irregular scrutiny, has taken on new urgency during the pandemic. If you have hundreds of thousands of workers, it is hard to keep them six feet apart. There have been reports of the coronavirus in more than 50 Amazon warehouses, and 15 state attorneys general have said the company\u2019s sick leave policies are inadequate. After a French court ruled Amazon had failed to adequately protect its workers, the company suspended operations at its warehouses in the country.\n\nAmazon, which announced on Monday that it would hire an additional 75,000 workers, has pushed back aggressively. In his letter to shareholders, Mr. Bezos wrote that the company was \u201cconsulting closely with medical experts and health authorities,\u201d and that as a result it had made \u201cover 150 significant process changes in our operations network and Whole Foods Market stores.\u201d It is experimenting with the use of disinfectant fog and has started checking workers\u2019 temperatures as they enter warehouses.\n\nIt is also cracking down on dissent. On April 12, two Amazon employees who had been outspoken about the company\u2019s climate change policies and, more recently, warehouse conditions said they had been fired. Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, both user experience designers, said their dismissals came hours after their organization, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, sent out an invitation to a virtual meeting during which interested employees could hear directly from Amazon warehouse workers.\n\n\u201cIf Amazon is actually keeping people safe, why are they so afraid for us to hear from people in warehouses?\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cThey are trying to silence us from talking to the media, but they are also trying to silence us internally.\u201d", "Model good news consumption habits.\n\nNews is like food, as Alvarez pointed out, and you teach your child good eating habits in part by modeling those habits. If you\u2019re checking the news on your phone while the kids are eating breakfast, narrate your experience to them. Not word for word, of course, but explain that you are reading the news, and that the news helps you understand what\u2019s happening in the world. As noted by Dr. Jenny Radesky, M.D., assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan, and lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement, you can encourage children\u2019s engagement by mentioning topics of importance to them, whether it\u2019s a new discovery in space or just the new \u201cFrozen 2\u201d trailer.\n\n\u201cI would recommend that parents find some slow time to read without distractions, sitting in a chair or sofa, and really put some concentration into it,\u201d Dr. Radesky said. \u201cWe want kids to process important information this way \u2014 not multitasking, not just responding to what is the most exciting headline, not tweeting with anger about an article they half-read. We should show our kids that the news isn\u2019t just entertaining and attention-grabbing, but it is a resource for making us better team players in our neighborhoods and our world, especially when we can really digest what is going on and think of solutions.\u201d\n\nAnd remember that, in 2020, the news might not have an off switch, but you still need to unplug. \u201cWe need to remind ourselves as parents to be grounded in order to be the best parents that we can be,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly bombarded by news, going from one social media platform to another, you will be overwhelmed. It\u2019s in our control to say: \u2018I\u2019ve had enough today. I need to enjoy my kids.\u2019\u201d\n\nRemember: Children can feed off your energy.\n\nThis is a tricky one. Even our youngest kiddos can sense when something is upsetting us \u2014 whether it\u2019s something that happened at work, or the latest headline. \u201cKids are watching,\u201d said Dr. Eugene V. Beresin, M.D., executive director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cFrom the time they\u2019re infants, they\u2019re looking at your facial expressions. As toddlers, looking at how you react, your tone of voice. My dog doesn\u2019t get on the couch when I watch news or sports, because I scream at the TV. He knows. A 5-year-old wouldn\u2019t, either.\u201d\n\nIf you get a troubling news alert during playtime, and it obviously affects your mood, explain the situation in the simplest terms, and again, reassure children that they are safe. \u201cMy kids would be like: \u2018What happened? What happened?\u2019\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018Someone got hurt. It\u2019s no one that we know.\u2019\u201d Explaining the source of your stress also reassures your children that the problem isn\u2019t them.\n\nWhen they\u2019re ready: Investigate kid-friendly media outlets.\n\nWhile your children might still be too young for, say, the daily paper or the evening news, they might be ready for deeper dives into newsy topics. Dr. Radesky recommends podcasts. \u201cIt could be about the slave trade, or the experience of immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be told from the perspective of the child, or you can dig into it from the perspective of a child.\u201d The tone of podcasts is different from the news, too \u2014 calmer, less urgent, more inquisitive.\n\nCommon Sense has a helpful list of kid-friendly news outlets, arranged by age level. (Alvarez especially recommends Newsela, a free, bilingual website and app that provide different news readings for different grade levels.) These include print publications, online outlets and mobile apps (as well as The Learning Network from The Times). News-adjacent publications like Sports Illustrated for Kids can get children into the habit of reading about current events. (Bonus: Kids love getting mail.)", "This story was originally published on Jan. 17, 2020 in NYT Parenting.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been pregnant, you probably know this routine: Every few weeks, you clear a couple of hours on your schedule for a prenatal checkup.\n\nYou sit in a waiting room. Maybe you scroll through a pregnancy app on your phone, but you probably don\u2019t strike up a conversation with the woman next to you. Maybe you make a list of your questions: How risky is deli meat, really? What\u2019s that stabbing pain in your side? Finally, a nurse calls your name and takes your blood pressure and weight. You wait some more. Another medical professional measures your belly, checks the fetal heart rate and, if all is well, you\u2019re done. That list of questions? Make it snappy.\n\n[Pregnancy pains got you down? Read this.]\n\nEven if everything is fine, prenatal care is seldom satisfying or particularly informative. But could prenatal care evolve to be more patient-centered \u2014 and maybe even more medically effective? That\u2019s the way some researchers and providers describe a new model called group prenatal care.", "You can also post a request through job boards at a local college, such as a nursing school, where students are looking for part-time, flexible work. The drawback is that their schedules change by semester or class.\n\nSeveral apps and websites also help parents find babysitters, including Care.com, UrbanSitter and others; within Facebook, you will most likely find local parenting groups where parents will recommend sitters. A caregiver staffing agency can also help you find vetted candidates, but at a cost.\n\nConsider experience, energy and engagement levels.\n\nExperience: What kind of experience do they have in infant care? This should not be their first time. Ideally, you want to find someone who has taken care of a child in your baby\u2019s age range.\n\nYour sitter should also have basic first aid and CPR training and know how to respond in an emergency. The American Red Cross offers both online and in-person classes for babysitting, child care, first aid and CPR. Those who complete it receive a certificate. Even family and friends should consider taking a first aid and CPR class, so that they\u2019re prepared for an emergency, said Dr. Angela Mattke, a pediatrician with the Mayo Clinic. You can offer to cover the cost of the class, or even join them for a refresher.\n\nEnergy: Taking care of a baby is exhausting. Particularly if you plan on relying on grandparents, you will want to assess their energy level. Take time to observe: Can they make it up and down the stairs without too much effort? Can they handle a squirmy baby, or change the diaper of a baby who is trying to roll over? Can they bend over and pick up the baby from the crib? If they plan to drive somewhere, can they get the baby into the carseat and buckle in the baby? Sometimes it may take both grandparents, working in tandem, to take care of the baby.\n\nEngagement: One way to assess if a sitter is a good fit is to have your baby with you during the interview. See how they interact with the baby. Do they get down on the floor and play with the baby? \u201cFrom 6 to 12 months, babies are learning early language skills by engaging with another human being,\u201d Dr. Mattke said. \u201cSo you need the babysitter\u2019s attention and for the babysitter not to be distracted by a cellphone or television.\u201d\n\nThe person taking care of your baby should also have strong communication skills, be open to taking direction from you and respond quickly on their feet.", "But the government was far less clear about how to relax restrictions later without causing another outbreak.\n\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary who is leading the British government while Prime Minister Boris Johnson recuperates from the virus, set out five prerequisites for easing restrictions, including a sustained and consistent decline in the daily death rates.\n\nWith 861 new deaths announced on Thursday \u2014 100 more than the day before \u2014 Britain appears far from meeting that prerequisite, as well as others that Mr. Raab outlined.\n\nTest blunder: The U.K. paid $20 million for new coronavirus tests from China in a global scramble for kits. They didn\u2019t work.\n\nHere are the latest updates, as well as maps of the pandemic.\n\nThe Times is providing free access to much of our coronavirus coverage, and our Coronavirus Briefing newsletter \u2014 like all of our newsletters \u2014 is free. Please consider supporting our journalism with a subscription.", "Most multiples turn out fine but there are discomforts and risks.\n\nTwins are by far the most common multiples, and most twin pregnancies turn out fine. But multiple pregnancies are often more uncomfortable than singleton pregnancies. Higher levels of progesterone mean you\u2019ll be short of breath from the start, said Robinson, and first trimester exhaustion tends to be worse. Later in pregnancy, heartburn and back pain are often worse. And you\u2019re more likely to be constipated, again from the progesterone, which slows the movement of your intestines.\n\nThere\u2019s also a higher risk of complications. The most common is preterm labor (labor before 37 weeks), and the more babies you are carrying, the earlier they are likely to be born. Twins in the United States are born, on average, at 35.3 weeks gestation and weigh 5 pounds, 2 ounces; the average singleton baby in the United States is born at 38.7 weeks and weighs 7 pounds, 4 ounces. Multiple pregnancies are also more likely to lead to pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure) and gestational diabetes.\n\nKalish noted that bed rest should not be prescribed to avoid preterm labor. \u201cIt does not reduce the risk of preterm labor,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it can increase your risk,\u201d because of the increased chance of developing life-threatening blood clots. However, it can be appropriate for people with very high blood pressure.\n\nMultiple pregnancies also have a higher chance of miscarriage. One type is called vanishing twin syndrome, in which an early ultrasound detects two embryos but a later scan finds only one.\n\nWith some kinds of identical twins, there are higher risks for rare complications:\n\nAbout 10 to 15 percent of identical twins that share a placenta (called monochorionic twins) will develop a condition called twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which arises when the blood vessels inside their shared placenta direct more blood to one twin than to the other. If you\u2019re pregnant with monochorionic twins (about 70 percent of identical twins are monochorionic), you\u2019ll likely get ultrasounds every two weeks to check for this condition. Treatment options include early delivery or, at some specialized centers, closing off some placental blood vessels with lasers.\n\nIf your identical twins are monoamniotic, meaning they share an amniotic sac as well as a placenta (as 1 percent of identical twins do), their umbilical cords may become too tangled, which can flatten them like a garden hose and reduce or cut off the blood supply to one or both twins. This risk will also be monitored by ultrasound, and if found, providers may recommend early delivery.\n\nIf you\u2019re carrying monochorionic or monoamniotic twins, Robinson recommends (if possible) seeing a provider who specializes in maternal-fetal medicine, perinatology, or high-risk obstetrics, who will have more training and experience in finding and treating complications than a regular obstetrician.\n\nSee a lactation consultant before birth.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to try breastfeeding (with or without supplemental formula), Goodnight and Robinson both recommended seeing a lactation consultant before your babies are born. Breastfeeding twins is often successful but can be hard, they said, purely because of the logistics and time involved. In addition to seeing a lactation consultant, good nutrition, hydration and good social support can help with some of the challenges, said Goodnight. But don\u2019t beat yourself up if your multiples are not exclusively breastfed. They will be fine, Goodnight and Robinson said. Feeding your babies some breastmilk in combination with formula is still beneficial. \u201cI\u2019m a strong advocate to moms that it\u2019s tough having twins, so if we need to supplement to make everybody in the household function better, I would encourage that,\u201d said Goodnight of formula feeding. \u201cI\u2019m not supportive of shaming.\u201d\n\nPrepare for the postpartum period.\n\nNew parents of multiples are at higher risk for postpartum depression, \u201cI think because there\u2019s a higher chance that you have one or two babies that have to go to the NICU,\u201d said Kalish. \u201cYou also are probably more sleep-deprived.\u201d In Goodnight\u2019s experience, parents of multiples, even those who did not carry the pregnancy, describe \u201cmore marital stress, a slower return to work, financial stress, more sleep deprivation,\u201d he said. You don\u2019t need to fear developing postpartum depression just because you\u2019re pregnant with multiples, but if you know to look out for it, you might notice it and be able to get help sooner.\n\nGoodnight recommends that his patients begin setting up their social support networks about halfway through pregnancy (20 weeks), whether that\u2019s asking family or friends when they can come to help, asking a friend to set up a meal or chore train, or lining up a postpartum doula or night nurse. Looking for a group of other parents of multiples, either online or in person, can be helpful too, according to Ring. And getting a pediatrician lined up early in the third trimester, said Robinson, means you won\u2019t have to look for one while juggling two newborns even if you go into labor earlier than expected. If possible, choose one near you with easy parking or transit accessibility, because transporting multiple babies is harder.", "In June, following President Trump\u2019s call to end surprise billing, the Senate health committee approved a package of bills aiming to lower the cost of medical care, including a plan to end unexpected air ambulance bills \u2014 in part by requiring air ambulance companies to accept in-network rates from insurance companies.\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services, an industry trade group, says that air ambulance companies have high fixed costs including nurses, mechanics and pilots, and that this legislation would cause bases to close. There are about 550,000 air ambulance transports each year in the United States, according to the association\u2019s estimates.\n\n\u201cWe definitely want to find a solution that removes patients from the billing process, and does not result in balance billing, but also that preserves air ambulance services and ensures our ability to keep transporting those patients in need,\u201d said Christopher Eastlee, the vice president of government relations at the association.\n\nA 2017 report from the association found that the median cost of an air ambulance transport in 2015 was about $10,200, but providers don\u2019t always receive that amount. For example, Medicare, a federal insurance program for those over 65, paid a median of $5,998 per transport, the report said. Medicaid, a public health insurance program largely for low-income people, paid a median of $3,463. The uninsured paid about $354 out of pocket. To make up the deficit, the group says, those who are commercially insured must shoulder a greater burden. And that can lead to large bills that catch consumers by surprise.\n\n\u201cThe cost of uncompensated care can be tremendous and it is by far the largest component of any bill,\u201d Mr. Eastlee said. \u201cFor every single patient that doesn\u2019t pay the cost, those costs have to be shifted to the next patient. That is true of any health care endeavor.\u201d\n\nState legislators are also debating how to reduce air ambulance bills. Wyoming is seeking approval to use Medicaid to cover the state\u2019s medical air transportation, and Minnesota is considering a bill that would require providers to publish prices for their services. Florida, Maryland, New Mexico and North Dakota have also taken steps to educate the public about air ambulance balance billing.\n\nSome families, especially those who live in rural areas, pay for a yearly membership offered by some air ambulance providers, which covers costs that insurance doesn\u2019t pay. But patients don\u2019t typically get to choose which provider they use, so if a different company arrived at the scene during an emergency, the membership would offer no cost advantage.", "\u201cI have times when I\u2019m down or depressed because of the situation, but I probably keep them to myself a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, I could\u2019ve had a brain injury, so I\u2019m grateful for that.

Some in his sport make sure he remains included.\n\nJuan Pablo Gnecco, a Grand Prix rider, asked Babington to help evaluate more than 100 horses for an auction in February, where 17 horses, including one whose proceeds would go to Babington\u2019s foundation, were offered for sale. Babington watched video of the horses jumping and sent Gnecco a half-page write-up on each one. \u201cReally like this horse,\u201d he said about one chestnut 5-year-old. \u201cTechnique changes a little from jump to jump, but I don\u2019t mind because it\u2019s an effort to be careful.\u201d\n\nWhen Gnecco received the pages, he choked up.

I borrowed a dress. I went to Instagram and looked at some of my friends\u2019 prom photos from last year, and saw one that I liked, so I screenshotted it and asked if I could borrow it. I\u2019ve had the same friend group since freshman year, and we take pictures together for every dance. It\u2019s sad that we don\u2019t get to get our last dance photo shoot together. I thought it\u2019d be like the movies and I\u2019d get to take photos with my friends, you know?\n\nSunny Yang, another senior at Mercy High School, says:\n\nProm is a really big deal. Since it\u2019s an all-girls school, we pick one prom queen and two princesses. I ordered my dress before spring break, in February. I was so excited, and I wanted to be prepared so I could plan my makeup and the jewelry, color-coding my outfit. For me, it\u2019s a day to be a princess. We wear uniforms all the time. We don\u2019t get to wear jeans or any cute tops, so it was a day where I can wear something special and cute. It\u2019s a day to treat myself: spending money, looking gorgeous, looking happy all that day, not worrying about homework. The very first job that I got was to save up money for prom. I\u2019m an immigrant from South Korea. I came here for high school. I tell my Korean friends that prom\u2019s a big deal because it\u2019s the last day that you can actually enjoy whatever you want to do before you graduate high school. I had the Disney Channel in Korea, and all the high school movies always had a prom. I wanted to have that experience at least once.\n\nGunnar Duke, a senior at Central High School, says:\n\nI was disappointed when prom got canceled, because I always wear a suit that stands out a lot. This year was going to be all dark purple satin material. It had eagle cuff links, which is the mascot of our high school, and it was going to have a white cape around it, and I had golden spiked shoes that matched a golden bow tie. It was going to look really cool. I just like being different, standing out. At junior prom, I wore this pink leopard suit. My grandma makes all my suits from scratch. She has since sophomore year. I usually come up with an idea, and then we go pick out a fabric that she likes, and she shows me how it\u2019ll turn out. She\u2019s already done with the suit part, but she\u2019s not done with the cape. I usually always post pictures of my outfit on Instagram \u2014 it just won\u2019t be the same. It\u2019s just kind of sad because the reason that it was canceled is all out of our control. There\u2019s not a lot we can do about it. But I missed out only a little bit, because most people get two proms and I only had one. If I have kids, I\u2019ll tell them to make the most of their prom and don\u2019t have any regrets, because something might just come up like this again. You never know when it\u2019s your last prom.\n\nKaya Koraleski, another senior at Central High School, says:\n\nJunior prom isn\u2019t that great, in my opinion, so I was super excited for senior prom. Prom is pretty much a rite of culture for Omaha kids. It\u2019s the big night to get super dressed up. It\u2019s always been a huge thing to go out and buy your dress early. I got my dress in December or January. Me and my two best girlfriends went to Von Maur here in Omaha, and it was like, prom is so far away, we\u2019re not going to find a dress, and then I found the perfect one. I have this navy blue, long, super sparkly dress, because I wanted a dress with the themes of the roaring 20s, which is the theme of our year. I had my hair figured out in February.

All my classes are moved online to doing Zoom meetings, and we\u2019re talking in my government class about how this could be happening in the fall again, and it just sounds like a nightmare that this is going to happen during my freshman year of college, too.

But for most of us, the situation right now is difficult but not devastating. We can help our teenagers square up to their unwanted emotions and guide them toward the most adaptive ways to manage their psychological distress. Here\u2019s how to start.\n\nDon\u2019t confuse emotionality with fragility\n\nParents can worry that an intensely upset teenager might be approaching some perilous psychological edge, and teenagers can even have the same concern about themselves. But in fact, there\u2019s a lot of cushion built into the system. Adolescent emotions tend to arrive in waves that rise, crest and recede on their own. Keeping this in mind, we can help our teenagers by responding to their distress in ways that are empathic and supportive, rather than anxious or minimizing.\n\nWe should also make sure our adolescents understand that feeling troubled during troubling times is not, on its own, grounds for concern \u2014 if anything, it\u2019s likely to be evidence of their robust mental health. We might warmly say, \u201cIt makes sense that you\u2019re worried about what\u2019s ahead. In fact, it would very be strange if you weren\u2019t.

The resulting hardships \u2014 both present and still to come \u2014 fall most heavily on the already disadvantaged. This terrible suffering demands an exceptional response, and policies that were controversial just months ago are common sense today, or ought to be. Our extraordinary battle against the pandemic should draw on the immense reserves that the most privileged among us have accumulated over decades of abundance. To achieve this goal, America should institute a wealth tax.\n\nCongress has already enacted three bipartisan relief packages, including the Cares Act, that collectively provide roughly $2 trillion in pandemic aid. Further assistance is hopefully on the way. These are necessary but enormous public expenses. To put them in perspective, the stimulus package enacted in the shadow of the Great Recession was $831 billion, while recent annual federal budget deficits average about $700 billion.\n\nCongress has rightly been more concerned with providing pandemic relief than with paying for it. But eventually, the bill will come due. Government borrowing is tempting because debt is now so cheap. But borrowing will in the end burden the young, who \u2014 already worse off than their parents\u2019 generation \u2014 are now suffering their second economic calamity in a decade. Instead, the relief effort should be funded through a one-time wealth tax imposed on the richest Americans, whose wealth has exploded alongside rising inequality.\n\nThe precise contours of such a tax obviously require detailed design. Still, a rough outline illustrates the basic idea. The wealthiest 5 percent of American families now hold $57 trillion, or two-thirds of all household wealth in the country (up from about half in 1960). An exemption for the first $2.5 million of household wealth would exclude the bottom 95 percent from paying any tax at all and leave the top 5 percent with total taxable wealth of roughly $40 trillion. A 5 percent tax on the richest 5 percent of households could thus raise up to $2 trillion."], "20200421": ["Activists nationwide have pivoted to online meetings, Slack trainings and a renewed focus on social media. \u201cWe were planning on knocking on doors and talking with people about the census, checking on their voter registration and giving them a calendar of election dates,\u201d said Martha Shockey, 65, who founded an Indivisible group in the Atlanta suburbs. \u201cIt took a couple of weeks for us to figure out how we would do any of that work in this environment.\u201d\n\nTwitter, Facebook and other platforms can help sustain vital links between organizers and their communities, said Theda Skocpol, a Harvard political scientist and co-editor of \u201cUpending American Politics: Polarizing Parties, Ideological Elites, and Citizen Activists From the Tea Party to the Anti-Trump Resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrises like this cause people to double down on the relationship they already have.

President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are trying to shore up domestic and international support after earlier cover-ups that allowed the virus to spread.\n\nAs diplomatic tensions rose and Beijing scrambled to control the narrative, the Chinese government last month expelled American journalists for three U.S. news organizations, including The Times.\n\nThe extent to which the United States might be engaging in its own covert information warfare in China is not clear. While the C.I.A. in recent decades has tried to support pro-democracy opposition figures in some countries, Chinese counterintelligence officers eviscerated the agency\u2019s network of informants in China about a decade ago, hurting its ability to conduct operations there.", "The calamitous coronavirus pandemic has befallen an America afflicted by massive, entrenched economic inequality. The resulting hardships \u2014 both present and still to come \u2014 fall most heavily on the already disadvantaged. This terrible suffering demands an exceptional response, and policies that were controversial just months ago are common sense today, or ought to be. Our extraordinary battle against the pandemic should draw on the immense reserves that the most privileged among us have accumulated over decades of abundance. To achieve this goal, America should institute a wealth tax.\n\nCongress has already enacted three bipartisan relief packages, including the Cares Act, that collectively provide roughly $2 trillion in pandemic aid. Further assistance is hopefully on the way. These are necessary but enormous public expenses. To put them in perspective, the stimulus package enacted in the shadow of the Great Recession was $831 billion, while recent annual federal budget deficits average about $700 billion.\n\nCongress has rightly been more concerned with providing pandemic relief than with paying for it. But eventually, the bill will come due. Government borrowing is tempting because debt is now so cheap. But borrowing will in the end burden the young, who \u2014 already worse off than their parents\u2019 generation \u2014 are now suffering their second economic calamity in a decade. Instead, the relief effort should be funded through a one-time wealth tax imposed on the richest Americans, whose wealth has exploded alongside rising inequality.\n\nThe precise contours of such a tax obviously require detailed design. Still, a rough outline illustrates the basic idea. The wealthiest 5 percent of American families now hold $57 trillion, or two-thirds of all household wealth in the country (up from about half in 1960). An exemption for the first $2.5 million of household wealth would exclude the bottom 95 percent from paying any tax at all and leave the top 5 percent with total taxable wealth of roughly $40 trillion. A 5 percent tax on the richest 5 percent of households could thus raise up to $2 trillion.", "Two days before learning that she would lose her job, Lissa Gilliam spent hundreds of dollars online on baby products.\n\nA 37-year-old expectant mother, Ms. Gilliam had planned to ask local parents in Seattle for used strollers and secondhand onesies in a bid to reduce waste.

Some of these roles \u2014 in software development or cybersecurity, for example \u2014 historically required post-college degrees. But the skills for many growing jobs \u2014 including home health care aides, occupational therapy assistants and solar panel installers \u2014 can now be obtained through targeted training. Successful examples of this model already exist, including a Google/Coursera partnership that has enrolled 130,000 individuals for software training that is recognized by multiple employers.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that nearly half of the occupations with the highest rate of expected growth over the next decade do not require a college degree. These roles, most of which can be held by young workers or seniors, can be achieved through discrete, targeted online programs and are projected to provide annual income averaging almost $70,000 per year.\n\nOur involuntarily idled workers can take advantage of their down time to train for the jobs of the future. We need a National Work Force Development Initiative \u2014 administered in partnership with a private sector consortium, appropriate government agencies and leading digital education providers, including Coursera, Arizona State University, Skillsoft, edX and others \u2014 that will not only prepare workers for better, higher-paying jobs, but also help America fill the millions of jobs the country will need over the coming decade.\n\nThis initiative would have four elements: targeting, training, credentialing and hiring.\n\nFirst, a partnership of private-sector employers and government agencies overseeing existing budgets for job retraining should identify the essential and attractive jobs of the future that can benefit from online, modular training programs.\n\nSecond, the world\u2019s best online professional development and work force training should be made available at little or no cost. This content should include both publicly available materials offered by schools with the best outcomes for adult learners, as well as proprietary programs offered by companies to their employees or clients.", "Walk you through the material. The best way to know for sure if your children \u201cget\u201d it is to have them teach you what they\u2019ve learned. The process of explaining and working through each step of the problem is how they can figure out which points they may be unsure of, as well as those that they have mastered.\n\nShow work by recording each part of the problem step-by-step. Remind your kids that even if they can do the work in their heads, writing it down will help prevent avoidable mistakes and execution errors. For this reason, many teachers require that students show every step of how they reached a solution rather than just recording the answer. If all that is written is the wrong answer, there\u2019s no record of the child\u2019s thought process. Moreover, if children make the same errors again and again, recording their work will allow the teacher to identify the precise area that needs support.\n\nWrite neatly and organize information clearly. All work should be done with pencils to facilitate easy erasing, and it\u2019s important both to label which problem you are working on and begin a new line of math with enough room to complete it. Smushed numbers often end up being misread both by kids and their teachers. Graph paper \u2014 if it\u2019s around or can be printed \u2014 can be particularly helpful for those who struggle to keep work visually organized.\n\nSlow down. Students often mistake speed for skill. Unfortunately, kids who race through their work are far more likely to make errors than those who take their time. Rushing leads to mistakes ranging from misreading directions, to computational errors, to skipping problems altogether. Suggest that your child decide how much time is reasonable for a certain assignment, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, and set a timer to work for that entire period, so that finishing quickly isn\u2019t the end game.\n\nCheck work over. Students should take the responsibility to check their own work over. But if they ask you for help, or you notice that they have made mistakes, don\u2019t immediately tell them what they have done wrong. Instead, ask: \u201cCan you find a mistake that you can correct?\u201d It\u2019s important that children develop the ability to identify and then fix their own errors.\n\nBe proactive about seeking out a teacher\u2019s help. Students\u2019 ability to advocate for themselves has always been crucial, but never more so than now, when online learning platforms make it more challenging for teachers to gauge and address individual needs. Many students are reluctant to reach out for extra help, so remind your children not only that doing so helps them with content, but also that teachers view questions as a sign of their students being invested in the learning process.\n\nSuggest that children tackle math work first if they think it will be the hardest. Students should complete the most difficult assignments earlier in the day when they have the most energy and potential to focus.", "Mary Schmidt Campbell is the president of Spelman College.\n\nThis article is part of our latest Learning special report, which focuses on the challenges of online education during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSpelman College recently celebrated its first virtual Founders Day. The virus had compelled the college (like all colleges) to empty its residence halls and abruptly shift from in-person to online instruction.\n\nDetermined not to be dispirited, students gathered digital images and videos from around the country for a week\u2019s worth of events. A live stream of a recorded Founders Day convocation capped the week\u2019s activities on the anniversary of the college\u2019s founding on April 11, 1881.\n\nAs I watched the celebration on my laptop, I could feel the joy wash over me \u2014 a reprieve, a moment of reflection \u2014 after moving at breakneck speed to become something we were not meant to be. Overnight, our small liberal arts college, designed exclusively for the success of black women, which cherishes close relationships among its Spelman Sisters and between students and faculty, had become a bastion of distance and separation.", "In America 2.0, we must address the changing work force and figure out a new way to formulate what an employee actually is, as the economy continues to change quickly. It begins by acknowledging after the crisis that our essential workers are, in fact, essential and not fungible.\n\nThe same goes for education. While it is no secret that the system to educate our children is broken in many places, the virus has shown us how quickly it can break for everyone and how badly tech solutions work as a replacement. I know of no parents, including those living in what are considered good school districts, who are happy with their children\u2019s online classes.\n\nWhile tech has long held itself out as the promise for universal education \u2014 for all from anywhere \u2014 the industry\u2019s ability to provide an experience that is close to the analog has been an embarrassment. It\u2019s a mishmash \u2014 including the security and privacy minefield of Zoom, the relentless lack of creativity of Google docs and a lot of confusion with basic scheduling online. This is true for those in lower grades up to college.\n\nAnd it is worse still for those without adequate internet connections or proper devices to do their schoolwork, the very children most at risk in these lost months. Tech-driven online schools do not work for the mass of people in any way that inspires learning. There is a real opportunity to come up with truly creative solutions to allow more students to thrive.\n\nInterestingly, the work-from-home technologies have been more adaptable. While the same security and privacy issues exist for adults using work-from-home tools, the use of video conferencing, combined with productivity technologies from companies like Slack, has made WFH a pretty good experience for many.\n\nI think a lot of employers will find that productivity has risen in the past month or so. Of course, this works only for \u201cknowledge workers,\u201d not for those who must be physically present at jobs, which points to the imperative to further fund an economy that can flexibly shift its work force to meet whatever needs come up. Work has been changing quickly and usually to the detriment of those who are in the jobs that will ultimately \u2014 and now much sooner \u2014 be sidelined by automation and robotics advances, which will now get even more attention to protect us in the next crisis.\n\nAnd if one thing is certain for America 2.0, there will be a next crisis \u2014 and one after that. While many of us like to think that this pandemic is a \u201cblack swan\u201d event that no one could have prepared for, there were many smart people who sketched out this crisis many years ago.\n\nIn his now famous and prescient speech at TED in 2015, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates drew an imaginary picture that might as well be a photo of right now. After outlining what could happen, he noted that \u201cwe\u2019re not ready for the next epidemic,\u201d and he clearly mapped out a way to make a new kind of world, one that could have been created right away:\n\nWe can build a really good response system. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. We\u2019ve got cellphones to get information from the public and get information out to them. We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they\u2019re moving. We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.\n\nSadly, his plans were not put into place.

The lesson: Socialist China takes care of its people, while people in the United States go hungry and the elderly die alone.\n\nEven if the stories were true, they didn\u2019t represent the full picture.

The data was gathered at sea from ships and buoys and on land from tens of thousands of observing statisticians coordinated by government meteorological agencies. It was checked for errors and changes in locations of collecting stations.\n\nHow hot was 2019? It was the second warmest year since data has been collected, just shy of the 2016 record by 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit (0.04 degrees Celsius). Decade-long average data, as in the headline, smooths out natural influences such as a volcanic eruption or El Nino/Nina, which affect climate. The data help us understand what we see happening around the world \u2014 events like the Australian wildfires, the melting sea ice of the Arctic and Antarctic, the Caribbean hurricanes, and the Day Zero water shortages in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nHere are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of this graph and map: \u201cTemperatures Go Up Up Up With No Way Down\u201d by Akye of Hoggard High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, \u201cIn Flux Because Of Us: How We Control Our Planet\u2019s Climate\u201d by Ms. Keohane\u2019s 8th Grade in Lafayette, California, \u201cPlanet Overheating\u201d by Lily of Seoul, South Korea, and \u201cThe Proof of Global Warming- Are We the Cause?\u201d by Gabrielle of Ohio.\n\nAnother headline, to paraphrase Dr. Renee Salas, a Boston emergency room physician who studies climate change\u2019s effect on health, could be \u201cThe Planet Has a Fever.\u201d\n\nYou may want to think critically about these questions:\n\nWhen did global temperatures start rising? If you say \u201cin about 1980\u201d, take another look. Re-read the heading and the line below the graph. When did temperatures first start rising? What was happening at that time that may have caused the global average temperature to rise?\n\nThis week\u2019s graph is a time series for 1880 \u2013 2019 with bars. The baseline average temperature is from 1951 - 1980. Last year, The New York Times published a 1880 - 2018 time series graph with points. The baseline was 1880 \u2013 1899. The data for the two graphs is the same except that this week\u2019s graph includes 2019. But, there are other differences between the two graphs.\n\nIf this week\u2019s graph used the 1880 \u2013 1899 baseline, how would the graph change? Why do you think the designers used the 1951 - 1980 baseline?\n\nScientists have determined that climate has become more extreme and more variable. Which graph best shows that temperature has become more extreme? Which graph best shows that temperature has become more variable?

What do you notice about the movement of temperature change across the world over the 140 years? Which regions experienced warming temperatures first? How has this affected these regions?\n\nThe 2010s global average surface temperatures was 14.7 degrees Celsius. To calculate the degrees Fahrenheit, use the conversion formula degrees F = (1.8 x degrees C) + 32 degrees C.\n\nNow, the 2010s global average surface temperatures was 1 degree Celsius greater than the average for 1951 - 1980.

The investment, which requires approval from competition regulators, would give Facebook a 9.99 percent stake in Jio Platforms, Jio said.\n\nFacebook said the move indicated its commitment to India. More than 388 million people in India have been connected to the internet over the past four years through Jio, Facebook said.\n\n\u201cThe country is in the middle of a major digital transformation, and organizations like Jio have played a big part in getting hundreds of millions of Indian people and small businesses online,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a post to his Facebook page announcing the deal. \u201cWith communities around the world in lockdown, many of these entrepreneurs need digital tools they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses.\u201d", "For Karen Arroyo, a medical assistant at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, the night hours now seem to collapse into one another. She moves among Covid-19 patients who are too weak to speak to her. She checks their vital signs and cleans them off when they\u2019re soiled. She wraps up those who are deceased and prepares them to be transported to the morgue. When Ms. Arroyo gets home at 7 a.m., she sprays her clothes down with Lysol so as not to expose her family.\n\nMs. Arroyo tries not to let her three children see the full emotional weight of her work \u2014 her fear of exposure to the virus, and grief from witnessing so much loss. But they can tell that their mom is struggling, and they try to distract her by playing her favorite songs and silly TikToks. Her kids have their own stress, too. Their schools have closed, and they miss seeing their friends; they worry about keeping up with classwork now that their lessons are all online.\n\nOn her toughest days, Ms. Arroyo likes to imagine where her children were last summer, and where they\u2019ll hopefully be again soon: Camp Junior, a Fresh Air Fund camp in New York\u2019s Harriman State Park. She likes to close her eyes and picture them kayaking and giggling with cabin-mates, far from the sounds of the city ambulances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an uncertain time, and I\u2019ve lost so many people I know,\u201d Ms. Arroyo said. \u201cMy kids really need to be back at camp. They need to be around people and nature.\u201d", "Going Further\n\nNote to Teachers: The first two activities include photographs and videos with intense and disturbing images inside hospitals. Please preview them in advance to make sure they are appropriate for your students.\n\nChoose one of the following three activities:\n\n1.) Analyze and respond to a photograph of health care professionals fighting the pandemic.\n\nLook at the images and captions in the photographic essay \u201cThe Epicenter: A week inside New York\u2019s public hospitals.\u201d\n\nChoose one photograph from the article that you found particularly informative, affecting or memorable in telling the story of health care workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.

What do you find interesting or moving about it?\n\nWhat could someone learn about the courage and the challenges facing health care professionals by viewing the photograph?\n\n2.) Watch and respond to a video documenting health care workers on the front lines to keep Americans alive.\n\nWatch the seven-minute video \u201cHeartache in the Hot Zone: The Front Line Against Covid-19.\u201d In it, the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof visits two New York City hospitals and witnesses the heavy toll on medical workers fighting to keep Americans alive.\n\nWatch the film and then write about or discuss these questions adapted from our weekly Film Club feature:\n\nWhat moments in this film stood out for you? Why?\n\nWere there any surprises? Anything that challenged what you know \u2014 or thought you knew?\n\nHow does this film add to your understanding, or change your perspective about the featured article you read?\n\nWhat messages, emotions or ideas will you take away from this film? Why?\n\nMr. Kristof says, \u201cThese doctors and nurses are risking their lives and we\u2019re failing them.\u201d Do you agree?\n\n3.) Consider ways that you can help and support health care workers.\n\nIn \u201cHow to Help the Helpers,\u201d Nancy Wartik writes about ways we can all support health care professionals. Here are excerpts from four of her recommendations:\n\nFollow the Rules It\u2019s the No. 1 plea of all health care providers and emergency workers: Maintain social distance if you go out. Otherwise stay home! \u201cIt makes us all nuts,\u201d said Dr. R. Sean Morrison, a geriatric and palliative care specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. \u201cI walk to work through Central Park. There are still people talking in groups, playing frisbee, standing together. They are vectors who could cause premature death.\u201d Help Procure Drastically Needed P.P.E. The virus has exposed this country\u2019s extreme shortage of masks, gowns and similar protection. Some providers have taken the unprecedented step of begging on social media for this equipment. \u201cWe\u2019re at war,\u201d said Dr. David Fleeger, a colorectal surgeon in Austin and president of the Texas Medical Association. \u201cWe need the appropriate supplies. I can\u2019t put my teams at risk to go into battle if they\u2019re not well equipped. We\u2019ve put pressure on the state, we\u2019ve put pressure on the feds and we\u2019re putting pressure on the community.\u201d Donate to P.P.E. fund-raisers on sites like Fundly or GoFundMe. The latter offers guidance on starting your own campaign. Multiple organizations are also pitching in: the Center for Disaster Philanthropy has a Covid-19 response fund. So does Direct Relief. Or, if you operate a business that has masks that aren\u2019t being used now, donate supplies directly. Repurpose a Hobby or Skill Like to sew? A movement to make masks for hospital workers is in full swing. Cloth masks don\u2019t meet N95 safety standards, but providers may use them if they\u2019re all that\u2019s available. There are a wide range of patterns online; see if a nearby hospital accepts homemade masks or connect with a group involved in distribution.

To help offset the isolation of worldwide social-distancing measures, the Travel desk has collected a series of stories to help recall the spirit of the annual event.\n\nSome of these stories will force you to grapple with the many threats posed by climate change and travel: carbon offsets, frequent flier miles, the moral dilemmas posed by international travel. Others will simply transport you to a distant corner of the earth.\n\nBut all of them, we hope, will remind you of the natural world\u2019s many splendors \u2014 and why environmental protections will be of crucial importance for the future of our planet.", "In a few short months, the Covid-19 pandemic has shut down movie sets, stopped global concert tours and pushed famous names to the sidelines. And it has also disrupted the creative lives of millions of others whose names might never have appeared on a marquee.\n\nBuskers have fled the subways. Community theater actors run their lines on video calls. With bookstores and cafes closed, poetry readings have moved online. Classical musicians have lost their incomes and their ability to compose with their ensembles. Dancers dance alone.\n\nOnce they spent untold hours practicing together, sometimes making a living. Now they are sidelined, trying to adapt. A photographer who once roamed the New York streets taking portraits now limits pictures to his apartment and his block. A nail artist used to the intimacy of holding a client\u2019s fingers now paints images on fake nails. A classical musician plays the violin for friends after a shared video dinner. A pop choir watches movie musicals together, singing separately in their Zoom windows.\n\nPractical concerns aside, it can be difficult to keep creating during a pandemic that has already killed more than 180,000 people worldwide. Even so, people who need to express themselves through their art are finding new ways.", "Some American intelligence officers are especially concerned about disinformation aimed at Europeans that pro-China actors appear to have helped spread. The messages stress the idea of disunity among European nations during the crisis and praise China\u2019s \u201cdonation diplomacy,\u201d American officials said. Left unmentioned are reports of Chinese companies delivering shoddy equipment and European leaders expressing skepticism over China\u2019s handling of its outbreak.\n\nMr. Trump himself has shown little concern about China\u2019s actions. He has consistently praised the handling of the pandemic by Chinese leaders \u2014 \u201cMuch respect!\u201d he wrote on Twitter on March 27. Three days later, he dismissed worries over China\u2019s use of disinformation when asked about it on Fox News.\n\n\u201cThey do it and we do it and we call them different things,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery country does it.\u201d\n\nAsked about the new accusations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement on Tuesday that said, \u201cThe relevant statements are complete nonsense and not worth refuting.\u201d Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman, has separately rebutted persistent accusations by American officials that China has supplied bad information and exhibited a broader lack of transparency during the pandemic. \u201cWe urge the U.S. to stop political manipulation, get its own house in order and focus more on fighting the epidemic and boosting the economy,\u201d Mr. Zhao said at a news conference on Friday.\n\nAn Information War\n\nThe United States and China are engaged in a titanic information war over the pandemic, one that has added a new dimension to their global rivalry.\n\nPresident Trump and his aides are trying to put the spotlight on China as they face intense criticism over the federal government\u2019s widespread failures in responding to the pandemic, which has killed more than 40,000 Americans. President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are trying to shore up domestic and international support after earlier cover-ups that allowed the virus to spread.\n\nAs diplomatic tensions rose and Beijing scrambled to control the narrative, the Chinese government last month expelled American journalists for three U.S. news organizations, including The Times.\n\nThe extent to which the United States might be engaging in its own covert information warfare in China is not clear. While the C.I.A. in recent decades has tried to support pro-democracy opposition figures in some countries, Chinese counterintelligence officers eviscerated the agency\u2019s network of informants in China about a decade ago, hurting its ability to conduct operations there.", "Two days before learning that she would lose her job, Lissa Gilliam spent hundreds of dollars online on baby products.\n\nA 37-year-old expectant mother, Ms. Gilliam had planned to ask local parents in Seattle for used strollers and secondhand onesies in a bid to reduce waste. But as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the area, new items delivered in boxes seemed a safer bet.\n\nShe figured she could afford the splurge, earning $50 an hour as a full-time contractor designing educational curriculums for a nonprofit. But then, on April 2, her employer slashed her hours and told her that her contract would end in early May \u2014 a few weeks before she is to give birth.\n\nSuddenly, like many others, Ms. Gilliam became hyperaware of her expenses. She and her husband, a high school physics teacher, now take a painful daily tally of their financial priorities: Is that $5 monthly web magazine subscription really necessary? How much does watering the garden cost? When will they need to tap their paltry savings?", "The people who are suffering the most are minorities. There\u2019s no question about that. By the way, that\u2019s in no small part because minorities tend to be living in major cities where they\u2019re living close together. But they also are the people \u2014 I mean, look at the people in the soup lines and the people waiting for The Salvation Army trucks. I mean, they are minorities as well. They are the ones whose lives have been really shattered.\n\nWe can use really good public safety measures, social distancing the work force, disinfectants everywhere, masks.

There\u2019s an argument that you can\u2019t go back to work without more testing.\n\nI have a strong feeling about that, which is I think that the people who are in favor of keeping the economy shut down, that testing has become an excuse to keep the economy locked down for more weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s become the mantra, right? We have to have testing. Nobody argues that testing isn\u2019t a good thing. But can we afford to wait three weeks or whatever it\u2019s going to take so we have all the testing? No. We\u2019ve got to start now. Look, the summer is going to be a catastrophe. It\u2019s going to be really, really bad. We\u2019re going to have long, long unemployment lines, and we\u2019re going to see 15, 20 percent unemployment, just horrific. They talk about bending the curve of the disease, but we also have to bend the curve of unemployment, poverty.\n\nAmericans, I think, are just under this delusion that what\u2019s going to happen is a month from now, it will all be \u2014 we\u2019ll have hopefully conquered this disease, and we can all go outside again. It will be sort of back to what it was. No. It\u2019s going to be like a nuclear bomb was dropped on the economy. People aren\u2019t just going to go right back to their jobs and so on.

Top officials at the United Federation of Teachers indicated that the powerful union would push back vigorously against any attempt to continue the school year online through the summer.\n\nMr. de Blasio has said the city cannot plan to reopen any schools earlier than September, spelling more uncertainty for children with advanced special needs who typically attend school year-round. And it is unknown when public libraries, where students can study for the SATs and catch up on summer reading assignments, will reopen.\n\n\u201cThe things that we would normally plan for the summer we cannot guarantee.

The slashing of nearly all summer programs will save the city about $185 million, and closing pools and cutting some funding for parks will save about $17 million.\n\n\u201cWe know many of the restrictions put in place to protect the health and safety of New Yorkers are causing unique disruptions in the lives of our kids, especially those in low income communities,\u201d said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio.", "Study after study shows that the United States is woefully behind when it comes to preparing our work force for the jobs of the 21st century. Some of these roles \u2014 in software development or cybersecurity, for example \u2014 historically required post-college degrees. But the skills for many growing jobs \u2014 including home health care aides, occupational therapy assistants and solar panel installers \u2014 can now be obtained through targeted training. Successful examples of this model already exist, including a Google/Coursera partnership that has enrolled 130,000 individuals for software training that is recognized by multiple employers.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that nearly half of the occupations with the highest rate of expected growth over the next decade do not require a college degree. These roles, most of which can be held by young workers or seniors, can be achieved through discrete, targeted online programs and are projected to provide annual income averaging almost $70,000 per year.\n\nOur involuntarily idled workers can take advantage of their down time to train for the jobs of the future. We need a National Work Force Development Initiative \u2014 administered in partnership with a private sector consortium, appropriate government agencies and leading digital education providers, including Coursera, Arizona State University, Skillsoft, edX and others \u2014 that will not only prepare workers for better, higher-paying jobs, but also help America fill the millions of jobs the country will need over the coming decade.\n\nThis initiative would have four elements: targeting, training, credentialing and hiring.\n\nFirst, a partnership of private-sector employers and government agencies overseeing existing budgets for job retraining should identify the essential and attractive jobs of the future that can benefit from online, modular training programs.\n\nSecond, the world\u2019s best online professional development and work force training should be made available at little or no cost.

The virus had compelled the college (like all colleges) to empty its residence halls and abruptly shift from in-person to online instruction.\n\nDetermined not to be dispirited, students gathered digital images and videos from around the country for a week\u2019s worth of events. A live stream of a recorded Founders Day convocation capped the week\u2019s activities on the anniversary of the college\u2019s founding on April 11, 1881.\n\nAs I watched the celebration on my laptop, I could feel the joy wash over me \u2014 a reprieve, a moment of reflection \u2014 after moving at breakneck speed to become something we were not meant to be. Overnight, our small liberal arts college, designed exclusively for the success of black women, which cherishes close relationships among its Spelman Sisters and between students and faculty, had become a bastion of distance and separation.", "In America 2.0, we must address the changing work force and figure out a new way to formulate what an employee actually is, as the economy continues to change quickly. It begins by acknowledging after the crisis that our essential workers are, in fact, essential and not fungible.\n\nThe same goes for education. While it is no secret that the system to educate our children is broken in many places, the virus has shown us how quickly it can break for everyone and how badly tech solutions work as a replacement. I know of no parents, including those living in what are considered good school districts, who are happy with their children\u2019s online classes.\n\nWhile tech has long held itself out as the promise for universal education \u2014 for all from anywhere \u2014 the industry\u2019s ability to provide an experience that is close to the analog has been an embarrassment. It\u2019s a mishmash \u2014 including the security and privacy minefield of Zoom, the relentless lack of creativity of Google docs and a lot of confusion with basic scheduling online. This is true for those in lower grades up to college.\n\nAnd it is worse still for those without adequate internet connections or proper devices to do their schoolwork, the very children most at risk in these lost months. Tech-driven online schools do not work for the mass of people in any way that inspires learning. There is a real opportunity to come up with truly creative solutions to allow more students to thrive.\n\nInterestingly, the work-from-home technologies have been more adaptable. While the same security and privacy issues exist for adults using work-from-home tools, the use of video conferencing, combined with productivity technologies from companies like Slack, has made WFH a pretty good experience for many.\n\nI think a lot of employers will find that productivity has risen in the past month or so. Of course, this works only for \u201cknowledge workers,\u201d not for those who must be physically present at jobs, which points to the imperative to further fund an economy that can flexibly shift its work force to meet whatever needs come up. Work has been changing quickly and usually to the detriment of those who are in the jobs that will ultimately \u2014 and now much sooner \u2014 be sidelined by automation and robotics advances, which will now get even more attention to protect us in the next crisis.\n\nAnd if one thing is certain for America 2.0, there will be a next crisis \u2014 and one after that. While many of us like to think that this pandemic is a \u201cblack swan\u201d event that no one could have prepared for, there were many smart people who sketched out this crisis many years ago.\n\nIn his now famous and prescient speech at TED in 2015, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates drew an imaginary picture that might as well be a photo of right now. After outlining what could happen, he noted that \u201cwe\u2019re not ready for the next epidemic,\u201d and he clearly mapped out a way to make a new kind of world, one that could have been created right away:\n\nWe can build a really good response system. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. We\u2019ve got cellphones to get information from the public and get information out to them. We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they\u2019re moving. We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.\n\nSadly, his plans were not put into place. But that does not mean we can\u2019t make new ones for the next phase of our lives.

The data was gathered at sea from ships and buoys and on land from tens of thousands of observing statisticians coordinated by government meteorological agencies. It was checked for errors and changes in locations of collecting stations.\n\nHow hot was 2019? It was the second warmest year since data has been collected, just shy of the 2016 record by 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit (0.04 degrees Celsius). Decade-long average data, as in the headline, smooths out natural influences such as a volcanic eruption or El Nino/Nina, which affect climate. The data help us understand what we see happening around the world \u2014 events like the Australian wildfires, the melting sea ice of the Arctic and Antarctic, the Caribbean hurricanes, and the Day Zero water shortages in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nHere are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of this graph and map: \u201cTemperatures Go Up Up Up With No Way Down\u201d by Akye of Hoggard High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, \u201cIn Flux Because Of Us: How We Control Our Planet\u2019s Climate\u201d by Ms. Keohane\u2019s 8th Grade in Lafayette, California, \u201cPlanet Overheating\u201d by Lily of Seoul, South Korea, and \u201cThe Proof of Global Warming- Are We the Cause?\u201d by Gabrielle of Ohio.\n\nAnother headline, to paraphrase Dr. Renee Salas, a Boston emergency room physician who studies climate change\u2019s effect on health, could be \u201cThe Planet Has a Fever.\u201d\n\nYou may want to think critically about these questions:\n\nWhen did global temperatures start rising?

The baseline average temperature is from 1951 - 1980. Last year, The New York Times published a 1880 - 2018 time series graph with points. The baseline was 1880 \u2013 1899. The data for the two graphs is the same except that this week\u2019s graph includes 2019. But, there are other differences between the two graphs.\n\nIf this week\u2019s graph used the 1880 \u2013 1899 baseline, how would the graph change? Why do you think the designers used the 1951 - 1980 baseline?\n\nScientists have determined that climate has become more extreme and more variable. Which graph best shows that temperature has become more extreme? Which graph best shows that temperature has become more variable? Explain your answers.\n\nComparable to the map in this release, the original article also includes an array of 140 heat maps for the years 1880 - 2019. What do you notice about the movement of temperature change across the world over the 140 years? Which regions experienced warming temperatures first? How has this affected these regions?\n\nThe 2010s global average surface temperatures was 14.7 degrees Celsius. To calculate the degrees Fahrenheit, use the conversion formula degrees F = (1.8 x degrees C) + 32 degrees C.\n\nNow, the 2010s global average surface temperatures was 1 degree Celsius greater than the average for 1951 - 1980. Use a formula to calculate how many degrees Fahrenheit this is. Check your work by comparing the above Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. If they don\u2019t agree, review your thinking on the use of your formula.\n\nIn the article \u201cWhy a Half a Degree of Global Warming is a Big Deal,\u201d The New York Times reported that, according to a United Nations report, the earth has warmed by 1\u00b0C since the 19th century. In this article, read about how global temperature increases of 1.5\u00b0C or of 2.0\u00b0C above the 19th century average could affect, for example, the Arctic, extreme heat, water scarcity and sea level rise, and plants and animals.

And that\u2019s true not only in their own schools or districts, but also across the country.\n\nSince mid-March, the Council for Exceptional Children, a resource and advocacy organization for those involved in educating children with special needs, waived its annual $65 membership fee.\n\nAbout 20,000 new teachers, administrators and aides signed on in the first couple of weeks, doubling its membership, said Chad Rummel, executive director of the Council for Exceptional Children.

Have you tried playing old-school board games? How about a raucous game of Pictionary over Zoom?\n\nIn \u201cClassic Board Games With a Touch of Tech,\u201d Catherine Newman writes:\n\nFrom November of 1955 to September 1957, my father played two games of chess with his friend Sam Frankenheim. My dad was in the Army, Sam was in the Air Force, and they mailed postcards back and forth detailing their moves. (Oh, to write the word \u201ccheckmate\u201d before popping a triumphant card in the mail!) Playing games with people at a distance has a long history \u2014 and now is as good a time as any to try it, given how badly we want to stave off boredom and bridge the distance between our islands of isolation. Digital gaming is an obvious path; my own son plays raucous online poker with vast groups of his friends. But there is something so grounding about rolling a handful of noisy dice, clacking our pieces around a board, and seeing each other\u2019s dear, missed faces (even if those faces are trash talking us about buying Park Place). To that end, my family has been experimenting with ways to play traditional, real-life board games with people who are sheltering in different places. With a bit of patience and some video conferencing, games can help virtually erase the miles between children and isolated grandparents or teenagers missing their friends.\n\nHere are three recommended games from the article along with some necessary hacks to pull them off:\n\nBattleship The classic naval-themed deduction game is a natural for videoconferencing, since you\u2019re not even supposed to see each other\u2019s board. Make sure to yell \u201cYou sank my battleship!\u201d at the appropriate moment, or else why were you even playing in the first place? Maximum number of players: 2 Requirements: A video conferencing platform (although you can actually play over the phone). Both players need to have the game, or you can download public-domain game sheets here to play a similar pen-and-paper version. Special hacks: None. Pictionary Zoom Pictionary is not the least chaotic game you\u2019ll ever play, but it\u2019s totally worth it for the zany factor. (\u201cSarcophagus!\u201d \u201cWait, no. Cable car?\u201d) We\u2019ve played over multiple time zones and generations, and recommend splitting up teams over households to keep the energy and engagement high. Maximum number of players: 8 Requirements: A video conferencing platform. Thick pens (such as Sharpies) for drawing. Only one household needs the game \u2014 and, honestly, not even that: You can use a random word generator for drawing prompts. Special hacks: Ideally, each household joins from both a laptop and a phone: angle the laptop toward your face(s) and balance the (muted/sound off) phone on something high (say an upended tissue box) to show your well-lit drawing surface. Eliminate the too-tumultuous \u201cAll Play.\u201d We also scrapped the fussy board: draw a card, roll the die, and pick the word on the card that your number corresponds to (six is wild); alternate play between teams and score one point for each correctly guessed word; play to 15 or 20. The drawer in a household without the game can generate a word randomly, or you can pick a card for them and hold it up while everyone else looks away. Monopoly The game itself is fun, of course, but one added bonus of your kids playing with their friends right now is that your home will fill with those badly missed voices. Maximum number of players: 8 (over no more than four households) Requirements: A video conferencing platform. Each household needs the game. Special hacks: Ideally, each household joins from two devices: one to show people; one (muted/sound off) raised up on something high to show the board. Mirror the other households\u2019 moves on your board. Mediate multi-household financial transactions \u2014 such as the paying of rent \u2014 through each household\u2019s bank. Remove properties from your game\u2019s stash as other households buy them and sort them by owner (we write each person\u2019s name on a Post-it) so you know who has what.\n\nYou don\u2019t have the board games or the technology? Deb Amlen provides some games that can be played in your house that require no equipment and little or no touching in \u201cRunning Out of Games? Remember These Old-School Favorites.\u201d Here are a few:\n\n20 Questions is a guessing game in which people try to identify a person, place or thing the leader is thinking about in 20 questions or less. Group members ask \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions until the mystery item or person is guessed. It\u2019s stationary, meaning there\u2019s no running around or mess and it can be played in small groups. A similar game is I Spy. Animal Alphabet asks players to think of an animal that begins with the letter A (like ant). The next person has to think of an animal that begins with the last letter of the last animal thought of within a certain time limit. For example, after \u201can(t)\u201d someone could volunteer \u201c(t) urtle.\u201d Continue the pattern until someone fails to think of an animal. Make Me Laugh is great for cheering up the housebound. Choose one person to be on the \u201chot seat.\u201d Set a timer for 90 seconds. The rest of the group has one simple goal, which is to make the person on the hot seat laugh without touching them. (No tickling!). Laughs, smiles, giggles and snorts can create disagreement, so one simple rule applies: If you show your teeth in the hot seat, you are out, and you join the group trying to make someone else laugh in the next round.\n\nStudents, read ONE of the articles in its entirety, then tell us:", "For Karen Arroyo, a medical assistant at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, the night hours now seem to collapse into one another. She moves among Covid-19 patients who are too weak to speak to her. She checks their vital signs and cleans them off when they\u2019re soiled. She wraps up those who are deceased and prepares them to be transported to the morgue. When Ms. Arroyo gets home at 7 a.m., she sprays her clothes down with Lysol so as not to expose her family.\n\nMs. Arroyo tries not to let her three children see the full emotional weight of her work \u2014 her fear of exposure to the virus, and grief from witnessing so much loss. But they can tell that their mom is struggling, and they try to distract her by playing her favorite songs and silly TikToks. Her kids have their own stress, too. Their schools have closed, and they miss seeing their friends; they worry about keeping up with classwork now that their lessons are all online.\n\nOn her toughest days, Ms. Arroyo likes to imagine where her children were last summer, and where they\u2019ll hopefully be again soon: Camp Junior, a Fresh Air Fund camp in New York\u2019s Harriman State Park. She likes to close her eyes and picture them kayaking and giggling with cabin-mates, far from the sounds of the city ambulances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an uncertain time, and I\u2019ve lost so many people I know,\u201d Ms. Arroyo said. \u201cMy kids really need to be back at camp.

At the same time, the Treasury Department and the Fed vowed to crack down on companies taking advantage of rescue lifelines with new guidelines and measures to increase transparency.\n\nRescue funds now come with more conditions:\n\n\u2022 The Treasury Department warned big publicly traded companies to prove that they need emergency loans intended for small businesses, after public uproar over such groups\u2019 borrowing tens of millions from the fund. It warned that offenders would be investigated. (Several companies, including Shake Shack and the owner of Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, said they would return the millions they had received.)\n\n\u2022 The Fed said it would publish information every month on companies that used its bailout funds, including names, amounts borrowed and the interest rate charged. \u201cThis seems to me like the Fed trying to pre-empt some of the issues that really plagued them in and around the financial crisis,\u201d Mark Spindel, the author of a book about the Fed, told The Times.", "In a few short months, the Covid-19 pandemic has shut down movie sets, stopped global concert tours and pushed famous names to the sidelines. And it has also disrupted the creative lives of millions of others whose names might never have appeared on a marquee.\n\nBuskers have fled the subways. Community theater actors run their lines on video calls. With bookstores and cafes closed, poetry readings have moved online. Classical musicians have lost their incomes and their ability to compose with their ensembles. Dancers dance alone.\n\nOnce they spent untold hours practicing together, sometimes making a living. Now they are sidelined, trying to adapt. A photographer who once roamed the New York streets taking portraits now limits pictures to his apartment and his block.

A pop choir watches movie musicals together, singing separately in their Zoom windows.\n\nPractical concerns aside, it can be difficult to keep creating during a pandemic that has already killed more than 180,000 people worldwide. Even so, people who need to express themselves through their art are finding new ways.", "A second is Julie Fredrickson, who recently sold Stowaway, a venture-backed makeup brand. She had become \u201ca China watcher\u201d out of necessity: It was where she sourced cosmetics. Because she was in the habit of reading supply chain reports, she perked up at early, disturbing reports from Wuhan. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t shut down cities,\u201d she said. Ms. Fredrickson was raised in the Bay Area but now lives in Manhattan, where \u201cwe enjoy showing off our water bricks in our one-bedroom and the go-bags in the couch.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s me. For years, I watched Silicon Valley preppers as an eccentric local tribe \u2014 at best goofball hobbyists, at worst elite separatists who fantasized about leaving the rest of us behind to die.\n\nBut in January, when I started to notice preppers in an especially high-pitched tizzy about some kind of pneumonia in China, I bought some Lysol. Then some gloves, a couple masks. I found The Prepared and devoured its advice. The site\u2019s central argument made sense: that preparing myself meant I would take up one less spot in the health care system in a crisis. I started to think about what I take for granted. It was kind of a game to play at night, trying to imagine how different parts of my world might falter and how I would stay alive.\n\nSoon I had a prepper box. Inside was flu medicine, headlamps, sardines, gloves, goggles, duct tape, a tarp, a Vipertek VTS-989 stun gun, some whistles. Because of it, I\u2019ve been able to mail supplies to my parents, and I\u2019ve been able to give precious hand sanitizer and high-quality masks to friends. I ended up over-prepping, so I donated the extra to a local clinic.\n\nI have noticed an instinct among those who first mocked Silicon Valley preppers as alarmist is now to call them smug. Certainly, some of them are. But the fact remains that they saw this \u2014 or something like it \u2014 coming a long ways off.\n\n\u2018How do I get a gun?\u2019\n\nAbout a decade ago, Mr. Ramey was living in San Mateo, Calif., and working as the chief executive of isocket, an online advertising start-up. One day, after coffee with a fellow founder, Mr. Ramey opened the trunk of his car, inadvertently revealing something he referred to as his \u201cGet Home Bag,\u201d full of the things he might need if disaster suddenly struck. (\u201cBasic stuff,\u201d he said: first aid kit, food and water rations, radio, multitool, map, compass, jumper cables, a blade to cut someone out of a seatbelt after a crash.)\n\nIt was, Mr. Ramey said, the moment that made him \u201cone of the first outed preppers\u201d in the Silicon Valley community. \u201cOther founders and investors started coming to me ad hoc,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019d say, \u2018How do I put a kit together?\u2019 And then they\u2019d get really quiet and ask, \u2018How do I get a gun?\u2019\u201d", "Even the makers of Clorox and Lysol pleaded with Americans not to inject or ingest their products.\n\nThe frantic reaction was prompted by President Trump\u2019s suggestion on Thursday at a White House briefing that an \u201cinjection inside\u201d the human body with a disinfectant like bleach or isopropyl alcohol could help combat the virus.\n\n\u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute,\u201d Mr. Trump said after a presentation from William N.

And teachers are eager to return to the classroom, saying they miss the energy of real-world interaction with students.\n\nThen there are the educational concerns. To make up for lost classroom time, schools may need to provide remedial instruction, additional special-education services and counseling, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.\n\nPolicy experts are also debating whether students who lag behind in key skills should be held back a grade, or advanced with extra catch-up support.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, who announced this month that the city\u2019s 1.1 million students would not return to classrooms until September, has said that many children will have to make up for months of lost learning despite the city\u2019s shift to remote instruction.\n\nBut there is also a pervasive fear about what it would mean to bring students and teachers back together too quickly, given all that is unknown about how the virus spreads. Forcing educators to work at a perceived risk to their own health could be not only a public health danger but also a recipe for labor unrest in a heavily unionized sector.\n\nJanet Robinson, superintendent of Stratford Public Schools in Connecticut, said she was \u201chorrified\u201d to hear the president urging schools to open. Students in her district were among the first children in the state to test positive. Her staff, including teachers who are cancer survivors, are worried about being rushed back into the classroom.\n\n\u201cI saw the president say, the kids don\u2019t get sick,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cWell, they\u2019re not in there all by themselves.

Then we\u2019d start this thing all over again.\u201d", "What is it like to have this?\n\nWhen you\u2019re diagnosed with Covid-19, the question is: Which group am I going to fall into, the one with mild symptoms or the one that needs to be hospitalized? That uncertainty is a real challenge.\n\nI started with the flu, fevers and chills, and then I felt better for a couple of days. I was optimistic that I would be better in a week. But then I had numbness in my hands, ringing in my ears, diarrhea and nausea, loss of taste and smell. I fell into the severe group. I literally spent 10 days in bed. I\u2019ve never had anything like that before in my life. I was dependent on my wife, who is a physician, and three kids for everything.\n\nI eventually went to the emergency department because I seemed to be getting worse. Saying goodbye to my wife at the E.R. door was one of the harder aspects of my illness. I knew that if I was hospitalized it might be a really long time before I saw my family again. So when the chest X-ray came back normal I decided I wanted to go home.\n\nIt sounds like you had a lot more support than most patients. How has your experience of being dependent affected the way you think about care others need?\n\nUp until this point, our efforts have been around preventing a surge in patients at hospitals.

If I were a single mom, there\u2019s no way I would have been able to manage my kids, much less myself.\n\nFor me, one of the lessons from my illness is recognizing that we are still defining what we need to manage society in the era of Covid-19.\n\nHave you made any policy changes based on your experience?\n\nFrom a public health perspective, we\u2019ve been focused on flattening the curve.

But for most of the country, the answer looks likely to be, not until summer at the soonest, and maybe not until fall.\n\nAnd when they do return, educators say, it may be to a very different school day and classroom experience than they remember.\n\nAdministrators are considering having half of their students come in the morning and the other half in the afternoon, or on alternate days, so that desks can be spread out and buses aren\u2019t packed.\n\nSocially distanced lunchrooms. Teachers and students wearing face masks. Temperature checks at the front door. And forget note-passing, study groups or even recess.", "Districts are also feeling the economic impact of the pandemic, anticipating huge budget shortfalls. And teachers are eager to return to the classroom, saying they miss the energy of real-world interaction with students.\n\nThen there are the educational concerns. To make up for lost classroom time, schools may need to provide remedial instruction, additional special-education services and counseling, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.\n\nPolicy experts are also debating whether students who lag behind in key skills should be held back a grade, or advanced with extra catch-up support.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, who announced this month that the city\u2019s 1.1 million students would not return to classrooms until September, has said that many children will have to make up for months of lost learning despite the city\u2019s shift to remote instruction.\n\nBut there is also a pervasive fear about what it would mean to bring students and teachers back together too quickly, given all that is unknown about how the virus spreads. Forcing educators to work at a perceived risk to their own health could be not only a public health danger but also a recipe for labor unrest in a heavily unionized sector.\n\nJanet Robinson, superintendent of Stratford Public Schools in Connecticut, said she was \u201chorrified\u201d to hear the president urging schools to open. Students in her district were among the first children in the state to test positive. Her staff, including teachers who are cancer survivors, are worried about being rushed back into the classroom.\n\n\u201cI saw the president say, the kids don\u2019t get sick,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cWell, they\u2019re not in there all by themselves.

And finding the therapies and experts that best suit a child\u2019s needs can be frustrating and time-consuming. But doing so, and early, can have a lasting positive effect, Dr. Landa said.\n\nHow do I know if my child is showing signs of autism?\n\nSymptoms of autism at any age fall into two categories: social communication skills and repetitive behaviors or interests. Symptoms can vary widely in severity and from individual to individual. Because autism is such a broad spectrum, assessments are made by taking multiple criteria into account, including the child\u2019s developmental history and observations of his or her behavior. The child\u2019s set of needs can then be matched to the appropriate set of services.\n\nIn young children, there are several key signs. If an 18-month-old child is consistently avoiding eye contact, there\u2019s a good chance that A.S.D. or another neurological disorder is at play. Another sign to look for before age 2 is a lack of social connection and engagement, Dr. Landa said. Pay attention to playtime: Children under 2 who express no interest in sharing or showing toys or insist on lining the toys up instead of playing with them should be evaluated. Another strong indicator in children this age is that they generally don\u2019t respond to their names.\n\nLewis\u2019s concerns about Cooper were related to language delay. Other early indicators, however, may be less obvious. Repetitive movements, like flapping hands, for example, can be an early sign but on their own may not necessarily point strongly to autism. Combined with other unusual preferences or behaviors, such as persistent walking on tiptoes, however, flapping hands \u201ccould be a red flag\u201d in a young child, said Adriana Di Martino, M.D., a pediatric neurologist and founding research director at the Autism Center at the Child Mind Institute in Manhattan.\n\nHow can parents help with early intervention?\n\nSpend lots of time with your kid and stay engaged. Join in the activities that he likes. Imitate his play and try adding a new element without forcing him to change what he\u2019s doing. Experiment. Part of standard early intervention is helping parents identify their children\u2019s comfort zone and learn to gently nudge them outside of it. Find out \u201cwhat your child can tolerate,\u201d Dr. Lord said, \u201cand then push them a little bit.\u201d\n\nLewis turned to a number of therapies to help her son Cooper continue to develop his communication, motor, and empathy skills \u2014 from sports to music to horseback riding. Cooper, who is now 11, is at the top of his class at a private school for children with developmental disabilities. He has an advanced vocabulary and high standardized test scores, said Lewis, who credits those first years of speech and behavioral therapy with her son\u2019s academic progress. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we would be right now if we hadn\u2019t received early intervention,\u201d she said.\n\nShould I worry if I\u2019ve missed the window for an early diagnosis?\n\n\u201cTry not to worry,\u201d Dr. Lord said. Research has found that children who are diagnosed later are likely to have milder symptoms, she said, so they may require fewer or less intense interventions.", "So what do they do all day?\n\nThey have no videos. No TV. No Legos. No children\u2019s books. No crayons. And yet, Raigili and Saarak find innumerous ways to pass the time. They are ingenious at coming up with their own games, creating their own toys and, in general, generating their own fun. No parents required. At times, all Saarak and Raigili need are a few blankets to keep them busy.\n\n\u201cSometimes, snug under the quilts on a cold morning \u2026 the two children played together quite happily, singing snatches of hymns \u2026 playing \u2018cards\u2019 with little squares of cardboard \u2026 Sometimes, pulling the quilts up over their heads, they just lay and giggled together,\u201d Briggs wrote.\n\nRaigili, in particular, has exceptional skills at self-entertainment, Briggs noted. \u201cI never ceased to be amazed at her capacity for absorbing herself in scarcely perceptible pursuits for hours on end \u2026 demanding no attention from anyone. \u201c\n\nDemanding no attention from anyone, I think as I stir the pot of beans. I wonder: Am I underestimating Rosy\u2019s ability to entertain herself while I write? If so, maybe I could actually finish a book I\u2019m working on.\n\nFor the past three years, I have been reporting for NPR on cultures around the world that raise remarkably cooperative and generous children \u2014 children who voluntarily hop up from the dinner table and start doing the dishes. Children who want to share their candy bar with a younger sibling.\n\nIn these cultures, you find a striking commonality: Mothers and fathers do not feel the need to constantly entertain and play with children. Parents don\u2019t see it as their job to tell the child what to learn, how to learn and when to learn. Instead parents give children an opportunity that many American kids do not have \u2014 to participate in adult work. Parents welcome children into the grown-up world and then have confidence that children will learn and grow, at their own pace, by watching adults, helping adults and helping other children.\n\nFor example, in many Maya communities, parents go about their daily business \u2014 cooking, washing clothes, weaving hammocks and taking care of livestock \u2014 while children of all ages play alongside and away from adults. Every now and then, mothers and fathers may ask kids to come over to help, but in general, many parents don\u2019t control what a child does or how they do it. If a child shows interest in an activity, such as sewing, the parent will offer the child a piece of cloth, some thread and a needle so the child can practice.", "If she needs Wi-Fi, she moves instead to the apartment\u2019s bathroom, sitting either on the ledge of the bathtub or on the stool her children use to brush their teeth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a few weeks now, so I\u2019m always prepared and I carry snacks,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a mug of coffee, a bottle of water and lots of nuts and dried fruit in my backpack, whether I\u2019m going to the car or the shower.

Here\u2019s what they saw in the photo:\n\nSelf-centeredness\n\nThis image portrays a scene that I\u2019ve seen in my own town, a bunch of people gathered together, holding signs that say things such as \u201cOpen Our County!\u201d and similar things like that. Some of these people aren\u2019t even wearing protective gear. I personally find these people incredibly selfish and illogical. First, this protest has at least two hundred people standing in close proximity to each other, so they clearly don\u2019t seem to care about the safety of others. If we opened back up all businesses, there would be a second outbreak in no time. 4% of the students infected in my school would die, which I personally find unacceptable. I would refuse to go to school if we opened up, it\u2019s just a bad idea all around. As hard as it is, we need to wait until it\u2019s safe to open back up, I just wish these people would realize that.\n\n\u2014 Cole Noberini, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC\n\nI have seen images like this now multiple times and find it quite ludicrous. These people are protesting against the quarantine stating that they have the right to go into the stores as much as they want and whatever store in that matter and they feel like they should feel welcomed to leave their houses whenever. I find these people selfish and unbearable. You should stay inside because doing so you are saving lives. Frankly I don\u2019t care if you want to have your store opened back up so you can go shopping if it means you risk making others sick. I feel like the people who are protesting this should take a step back and look at the risk factor. People can die from this if they are too old or already have a weakened immune system.\n\n\u2014 Cadence, Farmington NH\n\nIgnorance and misinformation\n\nTo me, this image represents how clueless and uneducated our country can be. While staying at home during quarantine is boring and taking away daily routines for everyone, it is necessary to get our country back to some type of normal. If everyone goes back to the way life used to be and states are re-opened, the virus will only infect more people, this will not do any good. We\u2019ve barely been quarantined for a month, it is absolutely not time yet to re-open our country and anyone who thinks so is not educated enough on the topic. Protesting in a large group where everyone is obviously not 6 feet away from each other and they have no forms of protection on is not only extremely unsafe for them, but everyone they interact with who could potentially get the virus from them. If and when these people get the virus, hospital workers will care for them like anyone else, because they chose to rise above their level of ignorance and danger, unlike these people.\n\n\u2014 Arcadia SV, Brooklyn, NY\n\nThis image is a represent of the ignorance and misinformation that has become so widespread throughout our country. The protesters shown in the photo claim that the government is taking away their rights by forcing them to stay home. Not only is this false, it is also dangerous. By failing to follow the proper social distancing guidelines, these people have become threats to society. The question is why are there people who believe the exact opposite of what every credible source has said on the topic of the current pandemic. In my opinion, it is the underlying distrust of science, government, and media that have resulted in situations like these protests or the burning of 5G towers. Some peoples\u2019 mindsets have become so ingrained into conspiracies, that they will dismiss any evidence against them as part of a plot.\n\n\u2014 Niko Jukic, Glenbard West High School, Glen Ellyn IL\n\nA government infringing on citizens\u2019 rights and freedoms\n\nThe image presented is most likely talking about the most recent virus that has spread from China, and how everyone is being forced to quarantine within their homes. I can imagine why people would be upset about this, everyone has to stop what they\u2019re doing, which means they can lose their job, lose their hobby, and maybe even lose their loved ones from the virus. In other words, the government is removing some freedoms, which people do not like. If you allow the government to take away some freedoms, they\u2019ll continue to keep taking away until there is nothing left, and that is what people are most worried about.

Notice how, in just 273 words, Louise Dorisca managed to write a stirring, beautifully expressed reaction to the 1619 Project, which was not just one article but an entire special edition of The Times Magazine. Then take a look at how John Fernandez Philippides embedded family history in his explanation for how a piece on cars changed his mind about data privacy.\n\nExample I: In 2019, Louise Dorisca of Florida chose The 1619 Project and wrote:\n\nIt\u2019s been 400 years since the first slave ship landed in America. Four-hundred years later, the country it was built upon remains. For me, the word \u2018slavery\u2019 brings up images of people, humans, being dragged away from the only home, family, and freedom that they have ever known, and being loaded into floating wooden prisons as cargo. From that moment on, they were no longer humans, they were slaves, and they would forever be. I thought I could fully wrap my head around the severity of it. However, truthfully, I was never one to lament slavery. I never personally felt victimized by it, though I knew that if I was born only 300 years ago, I would be a slave. When I was younger, I recall my father telling me about his country, Haiti, and how it was the only place on Earth where if a black man stepped foot there, he was free. I now understand that freedom from slavery does not come without a price, and Haiti is still paying for theirs. America is paying off their freedom, and it is very costly. Traces of slavery are found throughout America\u2019s health care and prison system, in the wealth gap, and in the education we receive, like scattered pieces of broken glass. And as long as those pieces remain, I will be a victim of slavery. Even though I didn\u2019t receive the whip to my back like my ancestors did, the scars will still remain. I am now aware of them. If I continue to be, maybe my children, and their children after, won\u2019t have to be born with those scars, too.\n\nExample II: In 2017, John Fernandez Philippides of Boston chose \u201cCars Suck Up Data About You. Where Does It All Go?\u201d and wrote:\n\nBorn in 2000, I have rarely worried about the risks of the digital age. But this article about the information that cars collect about us spurred a dramatic shift in my opinion about privacy and data-tracking. For a long time, I didn\u2019t care what information companies and the government knew about me. I couldn\u2019t believe that my mom required us to keep our new Amazon Echo turned off and far from where we talked. When I complained about her unfounded paranoia, she revealed that her reasons for moving Alexa were more complex than I thought. My mother\u2019s family lived in Argentina during part of the \u201cDirty War,\u201d a period starting in 1976 when the government abducted and killed thousands of Argentine citizens. Her father suspected that the government was spying on his family. When a group of soldiers entered their apartment and tore through his family\u2019s belongings without their consent, they fled to the United States. I learned that the fear of surveillance is more deeply instilled in my mother than it ever could be in me, and my apathy began to erode. Last week, as I read about how auto companies sell information about our driving habits and daily routines, sometimes without our consent, I wondered whether my family would have survived if the Argentine government had access to that kind of data and technology. Now, unless I need her, Alexa remains turned off in my study.\n\nTip:\n\nExplain the lens through which you\u2019re reading something, in much the same way Jordan Ferdman explored a moral principle to explain how she interpreted an article about the vaping industry.\n\nExample: In 2019, Jordan Ferdman of New York City chose an article headlined \u201cDozens of Young People Hospitalized for Breathing and Lung Problems After Vaping\u201d and wrote:\n\nI couldn\u2019t have been older than 8 years old when my parents introduced to me the concept of intent versus impact. The idea that when you hurt someone, or your actions have a negative consequence, your intent is not what matters. I cannot help but wonder if executive James Monsees understands my parents\u2019 guiding principle. Though he acknowledged the rampant use among underage Americans, Juul products continue to sell. The effects of this are not, by any means, difficult to find: Shelia Kaplan\u2019s \u201cDozens of Young People Hospitalized for Breathing and Lung Problems After Vaping\u201d makes this abundantly clear. The bathrooms at my school are affectionately referred to as the \u201cJuul rooms.\u201d A well-known \u2014 and admittedly overdone \u2014 joke passed around in the hallways is about \u201ctoilets in the Juul room.\u201d It would be easier for me to count my friends that don\u2019t own a Juul than to count the friends that do. The vaping device has become so ingrained in teenage life that it\u2019s difficult to go a day without seeing one peeking out of a pencil case or smuggled up a sleeve. Several of my classmates cannot go more than an hour or two without taking a hit in the school bathroom or, in some cases, the back of a classroom. Executives claim hooking teenagers on nicotine was not the intention of the company, which is valued at $38 billion. But it is the impact, and failure to not only own up to that but to take larger steps to mitigate its damages is a disservice to the country\u2019s youth.\n\n3. Reference specific details or quotes from the piece.", "The rebound of the stock market has served as a painful reminder that for the rich, the crisis is yet another shopping opportunity, a chance to buy things on sale. But its wild oscillations from one day to another \u2014 and even one hour to the next \u2014 also mirror our collective, pent-up emotionality and uncertainty. It is volatile, and so are we.\n\nKeith McCurdy, 34, a star tattoo artist known as \u201cBang Bang,\u201d who owns a shop in SoHo and first became well known after he inked Rihanna, felt his blood begin to boil after reading about the $10 million \u201csmall business\u201d loan Danny Meyer and Shake Shack received. The money came through the Paycheck Protection Program, the federal government\u2019s $2 billion coronavirus aid attempt for small businesses.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a public company!\u201d Mr. McCurdy said, going on to distinguish the difference between Shake Shack (which has more than 200 locations) and his (which has two). \u201cI\u2019m paying my taxes and doing things on the up-and-up in an industry that usually runs like drug dealing at a bar. When hospitals said they needed more protective gear, we sent them all the masks and gloves we had. When they asked for more, we got them from our supplier.\u201d Once again, Mr. McCurdy added, it\u2019s the wealthiest who get bailouts.\n\n(Shake Shack later said it would return the loan.)\n\nMr. McCurdy blames the federal leadership for that, but the delayed response of the state to shut down schools and to impose self-quarantine makes him nearly as angry.\n\nHe can\u2019t figure out why liquor stores, coffee shops and ice cream parlors are being allowed to remain open as essential businesses. His rage extends to New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, and New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio.\n\n\u201cWe paint rainbows on our windows and clap for hospital workers, but shouldn\u2019t we also be screaming at our leaders here as well as in Washington?\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cI want to have this tingly feeling, I like Governor Cuomo, but enough with the bromance with Chris. I watch the daily briefings, and I\u2019ve barely heard anything new about what we\u2019re really going to do to reopen or what his plans are for actual small businesses. Everything feels like \u2018wait and see.\u2019 Well, my landlord\u2019s not waiting to see. My mental health is suffering like everybody else\u2019s.\u201d"], "20200430": ["Some children with A.S.D. will need more interventions than others. And finding the therapies and experts that best suit a child\u2019s needs can be frustrating and time-consuming. But doing so, and early, can have a lasting positive effect, Dr. Landa said.\n\nHow do I know if my child is showing signs of autism?\n\nSymptoms of autism at any age fall into two categories: social communication skills and repetitive behaviors or interests. Symptoms can vary widely in severity and from individual to individual. Because autism is such a broad spectrum, assessments are made by taking multiple criteria into account, including the child\u2019s developmental history and observations of his or her behavior. The child\u2019s set of needs can then be matched to the appropriate set of services.\n\nIn young children, there are several key signs. If an 18-month-old child is consistently avoiding eye contact, there\u2019s a good chance that A.S.D. or another neurological disorder is at play. Another sign to look for before age 2 is a lack of social connection and engagement, Dr. Landa said. Pay attention to playtime: Children under 2 who express no interest in sharing or showing toys or insist on lining the toys up instead of playing with them should be evaluated. Another strong indicator in children this age is that they generally don\u2019t respond to their names.\n\nLewis\u2019s concerns about Cooper were related to language delay. Other early indicators, however, may be less obvious. Repetitive movements, like flapping hands, for example, can be an early sign but on their own may not necessarily point strongly to autism. Combined with other unusual preferences or behaviors, such as persistent walking on tiptoes, however, flapping hands \u201ccould be a red flag\u201d in a young child, said Adriana Di Martino, M.D., a pediatric neurologist and founding research director at the Autism Center at the Child Mind Institute in Manhattan.\n\nHow can parents help with early intervention?\n\nSpend lots of time with your kid and stay engaged. Join in the activities that he likes. Imitate his play and try adding a new element without forcing him to change what he\u2019s doing. Experiment. Part of standard early intervention is helping parents identify their children\u2019s comfort zone and learn to gently nudge them outside of it. Find out \u201cwhat your child can tolerate,\u201d Dr. Lord said, \u201cand then push them a little bit.\u201d\n\nLewis turned to a number of therapies to help her son Cooper continue to develop his communication, motor, and empathy skills \u2014 from sports to music to horseback riding. Cooper, who is now 11, is at the top of his class at a private school for children with developmental disabilities. He has an advanced vocabulary and high standardized test scores, said Lewis, who credits those first years of speech and behavioral therapy with her son\u2019s academic progress. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we would be right now if we hadn\u2019t received early intervention,\u201d she said.\n\nShould I worry if I\u2019ve missed the window for an early diagnosis?\n\n\u201cTry not to worry,\u201d Dr. Lord said. Research has found that children who are diagnosed later are likely to have milder symptoms, she said, so they may require fewer or less intense interventions.", "So what do they do all day?\n\nThey have no videos. No TV. No Legos. No children\u2019s books. No crayons. And yet, Raigili and Saarak find innumerous ways to pass the time. They are ingenious at coming up with their own games, creating their own toys and, in general, generating their own fun. No parents required. At times, all Saarak and Raigili need are a few blankets to keep them busy.\n\n\u201cSometimes, snug under the quilts on a cold morning \u2026 the two children played together quite happily, singing snatches of hymns \u2026 playing \u2018cards\u2019 with little squares of cardboard \u2026 Sometimes, pulling the quilts up over their heads, they just lay and giggled together,\u201d Briggs wrote.\n\nRaigili, in particular, has exceptional skills at self-entertainment, Briggs noted. \u201cI never ceased to be amazed at her capacity for absorbing herself in scarcely perceptible pursuits for hours on end \u2026 demanding no attention from anyone. \u201c\n\nDemanding no attention from anyone, I think as I stir the pot of beans. I wonder: Am I underestimating Rosy\u2019s ability to entertain herself while I write? If so, maybe I could actually finish a book I\u2019m working on.\n\nFor the past three years, I have been reporting for NPR on cultures around the world that raise remarkably cooperative and generous children \u2014 children who voluntarily hop up from the dinner table and start doing the dishes. Children who want to share their candy bar with a younger sibling.\n\nIn these cultures, you find a striking commonality: Mothers and fathers do not feel the need to constantly entertain and play with children. Parents don\u2019t see it as their job to tell the child what to learn, how to learn and when to learn. Instead parents give children an opportunity that many American kids do not have \u2014 to participate in adult work. Parents welcome children into the grown-up world and then have confidence that children will learn and grow, at their own pace, by watching adults, helping adults and helping other children.\n\nFor example, in many Maya communities, parents go about their daily business \u2014 cooking, washing clothes, weaving hammocks and taking care of livestock \u2014 while children of all ages play alongside and away from adults. Every now and then, mothers and fathers may ask kids to come over to help, but in general, many parents don\u2019t control what a child does or how they do it. If a child shows interest in an activity, such as sewing, the parent will offer the child a piece of cloth, some thread and a needle so the child can practice.", "\u201cHow does this image relate to or comment on society or current events?\u201d we asked students in our Picture Prompt \u201cProtesting.\u201d \u201cWhat is your opinion of its message?\u201d\n\nThey weighed in with their thoughts about the protesters across the country who have gathered to oppose the stay-at-home orders states have imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Here\u2019s what they saw in the photo:\n\nSelf-centeredness\n\nThis image portrays a scene that I\u2019ve seen in my own town, a bunch of people gathered together, holding signs that say things such as \u201cOpen Our County!\u201d and similar things like that. Some of these people aren\u2019t even wearing protective gear. I personally find these people incredibly selfish and illogical. First, this protest has at least two hundred people standing in close proximity to each other, so they clearly don\u2019t seem to care about the safety of others. If we opened back up all businesses, there would be a second outbreak in no time. 4% of the students infected in my school would die, which I personally find unacceptable. I would refuse to go to school if we opened up, it\u2019s just a bad idea all around. As hard as it is, we need to wait until it\u2019s safe to open back up, I just wish these people would realize that.\n\n\u2014 Cole Noberini, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC\n\nI have seen images like this now multiple times and find it quite ludicrous. These people are protesting against the quarantine stating that they have the right to go into the stores as much as they want and whatever store in that matter and they feel like they should feel welcomed to leave their houses whenever. I find these people selfish and unbearable. You should stay inside because doing so you are saving lives. Frankly I don\u2019t care if you want to have your store opened back up so you can go shopping if it means you risk making others sick. I feel like the people who are protesting this should take a step back and look at the risk factor. People can die from this if they are too old or already have a weakened immune system.\n\n\u2014 Cadence, Farmington NH\n\nIgnorance and misinformation\n\nTo me, this image represents how clueless and uneducated our country can be. While staying at home during quarantine is boring and taking away daily routines for everyone, it is necessary to get our country back to some type of normal. If everyone goes back to the way life used to be and states are re-opened, the virus will only infect more people, this will not do any good. We\u2019ve barely been quarantined for a month, it is absolutely not time yet to re-open our country and anyone who thinks so is not educated enough on the topic. Protesting in a large group where everyone is obviously not 6 feet away from each other and they have no forms of protection on is not only extremely unsafe for them, but everyone they interact with who could potentially get the virus from them. If and when these people get the virus, hospital workers will care for them like anyone else, because they chose to rise above their level of ignorance and danger, unlike these people.\n\n\u2014 Arcadia SV, Brooklyn, NY\n\nThis image is a represent of the ignorance and misinformation that has become so widespread throughout our country. The protesters shown in the photo claim that the government is taking away their rights by forcing them to stay home. Not only is this false, it is also dangerous. By failing to follow the proper social distancing guidelines, these people have become threats to society. The question is why are there people who believe the exact opposite of what every credible source has said on the topic of the current pandemic. In my opinion, it is the underlying distrust of science, government, and media that have resulted in situations like these protests or the burning of 5G towers. Some peoples\u2019 mindsets have become so ingrained into conspiracies, that they will dismiss any evidence against them as part of a plot.\n\n\u2014 Niko Jukic, Glenbard West High School, Glen Ellyn IL\n\nA government infringing on citizens\u2019 rights and freedoms\n\nThe image presented is most likely talking about the most recent virus that has spread from China, and how everyone is being forced to quarantine within their homes. I can imagine why people would be upset about this, everyone has to stop what they\u2019re doing, which means they can lose their job, lose their hobby, and maybe even lose their loved ones from the virus. In other words, the government is removing some freedoms, which people do not like. If you allow the government to take away some freedoms, they\u2019ll continue to keep taking away until there is nothing left, and that is what people are most worried about. I agree with these people, as the government shouldn\u2019t be withholding peoples\u2019 rights, but I recommend people to take necessary steps to distance themselves from other people to avoid getting the virus.\n\n\u2014 Bennett C.

And if news sources have to work hard to get the facts straight on something as lighthearted as Beyonc\u00e9, then they must work even harder to maintain the veracity of harder topics.\n\nTip:\n\nShow how a piece changed your mind or broadened your understanding of an issue. Notice how, in just 273 words, Louise Dorisca managed to write a stirring, beautifully expressed reaction to the 1619 Project, which was not just one article but an entire special edition of The Times Magazine. Then take a look at how John Fernandez Philippides embedded family history in his explanation for how a piece on cars changed his mind about data privacy.\n\nExample I: In 2019, Louise Dorisca of Florida chose The 1619 Project and wrote:\n\nIt\u2019s been 400 years since the first slave ship landed in America. Four-hundred years later, the country it was built upon remains. For me, the word \u2018slavery\u2019 brings up images of people, humans, being dragged away from the only home, family, and freedom that they have ever known, and being loaded into floating wooden prisons as cargo. From that moment on, they were no longer humans, they were slaves, and they would forever be. I thought I could fully wrap my head around the severity of it. However, truthfully, I was never one to lament slavery. I never personally felt victimized by it, though I knew that if I was born only 300 years ago, I would be a slave. When I was younger, I recall my father telling me about his country, Haiti, and how it was the only place on Earth where if a black man stepped foot there, he was free. I now understand that freedom from slavery does not come without a price, and Haiti is still paying for theirs. America is paying off their freedom, and it is very costly. Traces of slavery are found throughout America\u2019s health care and prison system, in the wealth gap, and in the education we receive, like scattered pieces of broken glass. And as long as those pieces remain, I will be a victim of slavery. Even though I didn\u2019t receive the whip to my back like my ancestors did, the scars will still remain. I am now aware of them. If I continue to be, maybe my children, and their children after, won\u2019t have to be born with those scars, too.\n\nExample II: In 2017, John Fernandez Philippides of Boston chose \u201cCars Suck Up Data About You. Where Does It All Go?\u201d and wrote:\n\nBorn in 2000, I have rarely worried about the risks of the digital age. But this article about the information that cars collect about us spurred a dramatic shift in my opinion about privacy and data-tracking. For a long time, I didn\u2019t care what information companies and the government knew about me. I couldn\u2019t believe that my mom required us to keep our new Amazon Echo turned off and far from where we talked. When I complained about her unfounded paranoia, she revealed that her reasons for moving Alexa were more complex than I thought. My mother\u2019s family lived in Argentina during part of the \u201cDirty War,\u201d a period starting in 1976 when the government abducted and killed thousands of Argentine citizens. Her father suspected that the government was spying on his family. When a group of soldiers entered their apartment and tore through his family\u2019s belongings without their consent, they fled to the United States. I learned that the fear of surveillance is more deeply instilled in my mother than it ever could be in me, and my apathy began to erode. Last week, as I read about how auto companies sell information about our driving habits and daily routines, sometimes without our consent, I wondered whether my family would have survived if the Argentine government had access to that kind of data and technology. Now, unless I need her, Alexa remains turned off in my study.\n\nTip:\n\nExplain the lens through which you\u2019re reading something, in much the same way Jordan Ferdman explored a moral principle to explain how she interpreted an article about the vaping industry.\n\nExample: In 2019, Jordan Ferdman of New York City chose an article headlined \u201cDozens of Young People Hospitalized for Breathing and Lung Problems After Vaping\u201d and wrote:\n\nI couldn\u2019t have been older than 8 years old when my parents introduced to me the concept of intent versus impact. The idea that when you hurt someone, or your actions have a negative consequence, your intent is not what matters. I cannot help but wonder if executive James Monsees understands my parents\u2019 guiding principle. Though he acknowledged the rampant use among underage Americans, Juul products continue to sell. The effects of this are not, by any means, difficult to find: Shelia Kaplan\u2019s \u201cDozens of Young People Hospitalized for Breathing and Lung Problems After Vaping\u201d makes this abundantly clear. The bathrooms at my school are affectionately referred to as the \u201cJuul rooms.\u201d A well-known \u2014 and admittedly overdone \u2014 joke passed around in the hallways is about \u201ctoilets in the Juul room.\u201d It would be easier for me to count my friends that don\u2019t own a Juul than to count the friends that do. The vaping device has become so ingrained in teenage life that it\u2019s difficult to go a day without seeing one peeking out of a pencil case or smuggled up a sleeve. Several of my classmates cannot go more than an hour or two without taking a hit in the school bathroom or, in some cases, the back of a classroom. Executives claim hooking teenagers on nicotine was not the intention of the company, which is valued at $38 billion. But it is the impact, and failure to not only own up to that but to take larger steps to mitigate its damages is a disservice to the country\u2019s youth.\n\n3.
